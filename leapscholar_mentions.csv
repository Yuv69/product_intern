2024-12-21 11:52:52,"What are your Reviews on LeapScholar? Hello Folks! I was researching for universities and the whole process of Studying in Germany for this upcoming Winter Intake and since the process was taking a lot of time and there are many small small things that needs to be taken care of I came across some Consultancies like EduOptions and LeapScholar. Eduoptions was a bit costly and Leap was not that much costly so I started talking with Leapscholar counselor. 

Leap scholar counselor said that we guarantee if u are eligible for a university then we will definitely get u admitted in that university and are saying we will take care of everything. 

But to me it sounds so fishy like they just asked me my CGPA and what am I doing now and not much even did not asked any of my profile for ex. extra-curriculars. 

They even told me that If u have so much trust issues then u can drop out.

Due to my work I am not getting much time to do research on these topics faster :

1. How to make SOPs specifically for a university?

2. Applying for different universities who\`s criterion is different and the process of VPD and UNI Assist?

3. Loan Process

4. Accommodation

5. Visa Application and what are small things included in that?

SO FRIENDS, I am here to ask you guys what are your experiences when u went through Leap Scholar?",Odd-Education-7415,Reddit,Neutral,0.024999999999999998

Ilunor had remained silent following our spur-of-the-moment sightseeing trip to Acela. 

In fact, all three didn’t have much to say at all until Thalmin finally broke the silence as we snapped back to reality. 

“Emma… although I have described your people as a *nation of scholars*, it was always meant as a tentative hyperbole. Because while I can understand that such an abundance of information might be necessary for a certain social class of commoners — scholars, scribes, civil servants, and the like — I cannot see how said abundance would be useful for your *average* commoner.” He posited only to be answered, not by me, but by Thacea.

“It aligns with what Emma had claimed from the onset.” She began. “That there exist no gods or kings, but only the masses. And with that comes the responsibility and the burden of collective rule, facilitated by collective intelligence, which necessitates an abundance of accessible knowledge.” She turned towards me, as if knowing I was ready to tag team off of that statement.

“We all share and chip in, in carrying the burdens that come with civilization. Or more accurately, the responsibilities of maintaining civilization. We all benefit from it too, of course, and much of what you saw was either blatant benefits, or just utilitarian tools in making daily life a little bit easier.” 

Thalmin blinked at that, gesturing at the ZNK-19. “*That* was somehow an attempt to make life *easier*?!” 

“Well… it makes things more *seamless*. Especially as it pertains to stuff like travel, scheduling, and so on and so forth. Beyond that, there’s also the added benefit of having both the compendium of all human knowledge, current events, *and* the infosphere plus the extranet at your fingertips.” 

I’d lost the prince right about at the last sentence, the man resorting to staring blankly whilst Thacea’s eagle eyes narrowed even further until they were only pinpricks.

“Erm, I shouldn’t get into it right now, but suffice it to say our *incorporeal world* also comprises a sort of… *communications network*. A perpetually active *web* of intangible streams of information communicated over our infrastructure, creating this sort of…”

“Webway.” Thacea offered.

“Yeah, something like that. Like a *web* composed of lines of communication, coalescing into this always-active *hive* of live data that anyone can access.” 

“What *purpose* would having a *webway* for the masses serve—”

“A tool for politics, I’m assuming.” Thacea interjected once more, swerving right into the lupinor prince’s winding and confusing train of thought. “If Emma’s world is what she claims it to be, then the only means by which the masses can rule themselves without a single or consolidated group of individuals becoming disproportionately powerful, is by a sort of… *democratization* of not just the legal mechanism of politics, but its dissemination within socio-cultural lines as well.” 

I blinked rapidly at that, my mouth hanging slightly agape at the princess’ rationalizations. 

“That’s a huge part of it, actually.” I nodded rapidly. “‘Free flow of information is the only safeguard against tyranny.’ High Commissioner Pravin Lal.” I promptly quoted. “Our modern democratic institutions were molded and reformed with transparency for the masses in mind. Discourses in all levels of the legislature are open to public scrutiny, and even those hidden for security concerns, have statutes on just how long they’re able to be hidden away. Scrutiny by the masses is made possible by our hyperconnected world, so much so that it’s often said that there are three auditing institutions a politician has to be wary of. The first being the Judicial Review Council, the second being the Office of the First Speaker, and the third being the High Court of Public Review — the prying eyes of a billion participants active in the infosphere at any given point in time.” 

Silence once more descended on the trio, with Thacea’s eyes closing down tightly, as if in deep thought following that.

Thalmin, meanwhile, had barely shifted in his expression, remaining in that sort of flabbergasted look of disbelief as if still processing it all.

It would be Ilunor, however, who eventually broke the silence with a simple, understandable rebuttal.

“Madness.” He scolded. “A system doomed for failure, either through collapse or indecision.” 

“There *were* times that happened, I admit.” I acknowledged. “The First Intrasolar War, to be precise, but that’s why reforms happened and… well, that’s a story for another day.” I laughed it off awkwardly before Thacea finally opened her eyes, staring at me with a sort of wariness I’d become accustomed to by now.

“These are solutions to a problem that didn’t *need* to exist, earthrealmer.” Ilunor surmised. “Such *complications* arise as a result of a resistance against what should be self-evident — the natural inclination for chaos without strong rulers. *This* is why royalty, nobility, and the aristocracy are needed. *This* is why even with your manaless dispositions, a tyrant masquerading as a monarch might simply be more *reasonable* than the unnatural state you force yourselves into. You waste *so much* in propping up something which should not exist, whilst we—”

“Can’t even provide a decent quality of life for your people.” I countered. “That’s the underlying difference between our two mindsets, Ilunor. We measure our success based on how best we can elevate the quality of lives of the masses; how well we treat the most vulnerable to the average joe. Meanwhile, you measure success exclusively by the exploits of nobles, tallying your achievements solely by their accumulation of power, both magical and otherwise.” 

We were just about ready to butt heads yet again, if not for Thacea promptly stepping in between us, placing both hands to separate our growing feud.

“Emma.” She began sternly. “Isn’t there *more* you wish for us to aid you with, in regards to your… artifice’s machinations?” 

“Oh, yeah, I was hoping to get some readings on some basic spells and magic. As well as like, a basic rundown of the *types* of mana just to calibrate the wand and—” 

**\[Notice: General equipment calibration in process… User interface prototype in queue… Warning: Additional data aggregation will result in a decrease of processing efficiency and reserve processing capacity. Suggestion: Delay additional testing until further notice.\]**

“... maybe that can wait.” I quickly added. “We’re burning daylight, and I think I wanna get some sparring done with Thalmin before we get back into the thick of things with the wand.” I offered, garnering a nod from the princess and a disgruntled shrug from Ilunor. 

=====

**The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. En Route to the Hall of Champions. Local Time: 1535 Hours.**  

**Emma**

I took the EVI’s pleas for leniency as an opportunity to finally take on Thalmin’s offer, as we both left for the Hall of Champions, leaving a visibly upset Ilunor to mope at the heels of an increasingly contemplative Thacea. 

While excited by both prospects, the thought of filling out *additional* paperwork in the form of annexes, addenda, and appendices when it came to the more *technical* projects sent shivers down my spine.

Though ironically, perhaps one of the largest sections to be filled in this week’s action report wasn’t about the WAID, but something that had yet to transpire — the GUN’s *first* true joint military exercise with a truly foreign polity. 

A paradigm ‘*first’* in all but pomp and circumstance. 

A paradox was quickly forming. Wherein a lot was happening in my mind without much, if anything, truly precipitating into words, let alone actions.

Words and ideas passed me by as quickly as new thoughts came in to replace them, creating this constant buffering where I had too much to say, without anything being said at all. 

Excitement, anticipation, and giddiness all clouded my mind, as I struggled to really approach what was quickly coming to be.

The sheer number of implications that this simple sparring match carried with it would’ve required a hundred committees to parse… before inevitably collapsing, re-forming, and then collapsing again all in the span of months. 

And here I was, tackling it alone.

Yet at the same time, I couldn’t get past the understanding of what this truly was — a friendly matchup and nothing more.

This wasn’t something grand, epic, or truly reality-defining.

Instead, it felt like a natural evolution. Another step in the path towards forging stronger bonds between two comrades in arms.

It was probably this functional disconnect between what was *technically* happening, versus what was *actually* happening that was messing with me.

And at the end of the day… I was probably just overthinking things again.

But I couldn’t help it, especially given how the soldier in me often butted heads with the diplomat I was also meant to embody.

This stray thought eventually gave rise to an opening talking point that was very much needed.

“So… how do you do it, Thalmin? How do you handle being so many things at once?”

“I’m sorry?” The prince responded, cocking his head as he did so.

“As in, how do you handle your disparate responsibilities? From what we’ve discussed, you are as deep into the military pipeline as you are a royal. How the heck do you balance state administration, international diplomacy, *and* your martial responsibilities?” 

“Ah, so the pressures have finally gotten to you, haven’t they?” The lupinor chuckled, crossing his arms as he did so. 

“It probably should’ve gotten me ages ago, but I guess the constant stressors have either started to wear off… *or*… my brain chemistry has probably adapted to being swamped in adrenaline 24/7. Either way, the effect remains the same. I kinda want to know how *you* manage to deal with it.”

The prince chuckled cockily at that response, crossing his arms in a show of personal pride. “Breeding, heritage, lineage, and *blood*, Cadet Emma Booker.” Thalmin spoke uncharacteristically, sporting a smarmy grin that eventually broke out into an uproarious laugh. “I’m sorry, I couldn’t help myself.” He managed out in between breaths. “But tell me, how was my *Ilunor* impression?”

The flurry of emotions that quickly followed was both confusing and cathartic, leaving me with little option but to catch the lupinor’s contagious laugh, letting out a series of cackles in the process. 

“Pretty good, perhaps *too good* if you ask me.” I let out through a relieved sigh. “Honestly, if our deluxe kobold carried himself with just *half* your stoicism, then he’d probably be a lot more menacing than he is.” 

“Well, consider me flattered, Emma.” The prince acknowledged with a dip of his head. “But in all seriousness, I will say that it’s quite impressive how well you’ve held your own, especially for a commoner. To be quite frank, the way you carry yourself and the decisions you’ve consistently made have pushed me so far as to have completely forgotten that aspect of your identity.” He offered, before promptly adding with a sheepish smile. “And I mean that as a compliment. I hold nothing but respect for your achievements as an individual, not **in spite of** or **because of** your supposed status.”

“Right.” I acknowledged with a nod, prompting the lupinor to quickly shift his tone.

“But to address your question, Emma? I’ll need to preface this by saying that I’m quite possibly the least *conventional* royal to ask for advice. Havenbrock and its royal family is, after all… quite unconventional, if you haven’t already noticed.” 

“That does seem to be the general consensus, not that I agree it's warranted.” I replied diplomatically. 

“Indeed. How I *personally* manage the handling of so *many* disparate responsibilities is simple — exposure. Exposure and experience are the keys to tempering the panic and nervousness that come with encountering unforeseen circumstances. This is the fundamental principle that both my father and uncle have raised me by, and the one I credit for my continued survival.” He paused as we reached one of the many twists and turns between the dorms and the stadium. “The life of a Havenbrockian royal isn’t about glitz, glamor, or stately decorum. It is moreso centered around the literal *fight* for survival, which in turn makes almost everything else seem *superficial* by comparison.” 

Thalmin eventually capped that off with another snarky smile. “I told you this wouldn’t be the answer you were looking for.”

“No, no. That… honestly aligns pretty well with something my Aunt said a while back, honestly. Especially the whole *perspective shift* thing about having been in life-and-death situations, and seeing everything else *after* that point as being kinda… trivial, so to speak.” 

This prompted Thalmin to raise a brow, just as we were finally about to leave the towers. “I take it your aunt is also a warrior in some capacity?”

“Yeah, she was. For a pretty long while too.” I answered frankly.

“Might I ask what sort of role she served?” 

“She served in our version of…” I paused, trying my best to actually explain the whole mission statement of the Terrestrial and Space Expeditionary Corps to Thalmin. “...a form of elite rapid response strike, recon, and pathfinding group trained for *any* environment; from space, to any realms floating within it, to traditional surface operations.”

The lupinor paused, pondering this for a moment with wide eyes. “So… does your Aunt ride those firespears we witnessed earlier into combat?” 

“Well… sort of. Like I said before, the ancient firespears I showed you are a thousand years behind me, so she’s—”

“So I was *right*.” Thalmin whispered under his breath, fist bumping the air in the process.

“I’m… sorry?”

“You showed that those firespears could supposedly be used to deploy people to the void and other realms. Internally, I had theorized that they could likewise be repurposed for the deployment of *soldiers* to any point *within* a realm. A sort of *void* legion, or perhaps even a *void diver* of sorts.” 

I paused, blinking rapidly at the excitable lupinor who I could only smile nervously at. 

“I mean… you aren’t too far off in your assumptions, Thalmin. Our firespears, even in that era, were *also* weaponized.” I admitted. “I just didn’t have time to include that in our presentation since explaining the void was much more of a priority.” I trailed off, garnering a narrowing gaze from the lupinor.

“Understandable. However, I *would* like a glimpse at such weapons in the future, if that is at all possible.” 

“Yeah, sure, I’ll… put that on the list of presentations when we get to it.” I offered nervously, prompting an equally suspicious nod before the lupinor moved onto another topic entirely.

“Forgive me if this is intrusive to ask, but considering your aunt’s service, am I correct to assume that you belong to a lineage of warriors and soldiers?” The lupinor questioned, raising a hand to rub the bottom of his snout as he did so. 

“I mean, it’s *somewhat* of a tradition, one that members of my aunt’s side of the family tend to take on sporadically. But it isn’t enforced or anything if that’s what you’re asking.” 

“I see.” Thalmin nodded, a glint of some deep thought behind those eyes. “You *will* have to tell me more about your aunt in the future, Emma, as well as her exploits as this… *void diver* of sorts. Provided, of course, that she’s seen active service.” 

“Oh, she *definitely* has.” I chuckled cockily. “If anything, she’s quite literally the most well-decorated veteran in living memory. Considering she’s participated in practically every major engagement in a flashpoint conflict in one of our realms. The one and only conflict to have erupted in our otherwise three centuries of uninterrupted peace.” 

Thalmin raised an excited brow at that, a fangy grin forming soon after. “I can start to see why your people chose you to be their candidate, Emma.”

=====

**The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts. Hall of Champions. Liring’s Training Stadium. Local Time: 1557 Hours.**  

**Emma**

We arrived at the Hall to an audience of one. 

Meeting a certain felinor who, after much convincing, approved us for a private booking of one of the smaller halls to the side of the main stadium. 

However, her reluctance to approve us at first stemmed less from our intent to spar, but a more pertinent issue still fresh in her mind.

“And you are *certain* that you have fully healed, Cadet Emma—”

I addressed the professor’s concerns with a swift movement of my pinkie, bending it to within its natural limits, before reaching it out to her much to her surprise. “I pinkie promise it, professor.” 

The bewildered professor paused for a moment, before simply going with the flow and completing the foreign gesture with a protracted pinkie claw. 

“Is this the work of some miracle panacea, or a result of your natural regeneration abilities, Cadet Emma Booker?” She pointedly asked. 

“A little bit of column A and a little bit of column B I suppose.” I answered coyly, causing the felinor to simply let out a sigh before donning a polite smile, one which was barely able to hide the burning curiosity behind those slitted pupils. 

“Very well. I won’t take much more of your time Cadet Booker. Prince Havenbrock.” She turned to face Thalmin for a moment, dipping her head slightly in respect. “If you need me, I will be in the stadium’s offices.” 

With that, the professor quite literally leaped away, disappearing into the rafters to the tune of a mana radiation warning and the whirring of the calibrating WAID.

At which point, I was reminded to quickly address the elephant in the room, before it became too large of a talking point during the spar. 

“EVI?”

“**Yes, Cadet Booker?**”

“Training mode, on. Active Assists, off. Save for the bare minimum of *actual* threat mitigation emergency countermeasures, of course.”

“**Acknowledged.**” 

If this was to be a *proper* training session, then I needed the EVI’s active assists deactivated. Otherwise, there really wouldn’t be a point to this.

Thalmin wasted no time in speed-walking us to the smaller training stadium, opening those two sliding dark oak doors to reveal what was, by all measures, a cross between one of those traditional dojos and a high school basketball court. 

The vibes and general aesthetic definitely fit the former, what with the heavy use of wood for the floors, pillars, and rafters. However, the presence of bleachers, stands, and magical lighting equipment alongside the wrought iron scaffolding gave it an undeniably ‘modern’ aesthetic that was difficult to ignore.  

The space certainly was more appropriate for a one-on-one session, though, as the size wasn’t anywhere near as overwhelming as the big open stadium it was connected to.

“I’d be remiss if I did not address a fundamental disconnect between our two peoples, Emma.” Thalmin began as he strode his way up and through one the bleachers, navigating us through to the center of the gymnasium. “The proverbial *wyvern* in the nursery, so to speak.” He continued as he moved closer towards me before deploying a privacy screen. “A tool — nay, a weapon —  that grants commoners the ability to kill from a hundred paces.” The lupinor stopped, gesturing at the distance between us. “Bridging the *martial gap*, in a way that only mages and the gifted can. Without once making use of magic, neither inherent nor enchanted.” He finished his statement, raising his right hand and extending a single index finger whilst clenching the rest of his fist, as if in an attempt to mimic the shape of my pistol.

“The martial gap?” I parroted, unclasping my holster in the process. 

“Aye, that which separates commoners from nobles, a fundamental crux rendering their attempts at harm completely null and void — distance.” The prince elaborated, taking the time to walk circles around me with his hands clasped firmly behind his back. “Physical distance is what underpins the martial gap, a functional disadvantage spurred on by a noble’s inherent natural advantages.”

“Ranged attacks.” I offered bluntly.

“Precisely.” Thalmin acknowledged, before once more stretching out his arm. “A noble’s capabilities in war are only limited by their imagination. Whilst those in their service, be they chosen ones or men-at-arms, would be provided the training or enchanted weapons necessary for accomplishing much of the same, albeit to an admittedly *lesser* capacity.”

The prince paused, halting his walk as he did so. “Roads to power, both soft and hard, can be traced to magic and those that wield it. For those without, their fates are sealed — sidelined to irrelevance by virtue of their inefficacy.”

He let out a sigh, raising both arms out to his sides. “For even if a hundred, a thousand, or ten thousand commoners were to march towards a castle’s walls… they would be burned, drowned, frozen, subsumed, or imploded before once setting their eyes on their intended adversary.” 

“And even those gifted with enchanted weapons all rely on mages not only for their production but also for their fuel, upkeep, and maintenance.” I reasoned, crossing my arms as I did so.

“Precisely. Which is what I wished to address next — that the martial gap applies to matters beyond the functional disparity of distance, but is also a term applied to the inherent gap that naturally arises as a result of this status quo.” 

I exhaled sharply at that. As despite Thalmin simply reinforcing what I’d already worked out, it just felt… jarring to hear it all laid out so blatantly, as a named principle at that.

“Your kind, despite lacking magic, have created a weapon capable of breaching that gap. Not just physically, but in every sense of the word.” Thalmin continued, his features stiffening if only for a moment, as it was clear *something* was currently spooling up behind those yellow eyes. 

“Now tell me, exactly *what* did your training entail?” He transitioned abruptly, as if trying to steer away from a subject matter that was bound to crop up eventually.

“Well… my training wasn’t *exactly* what you’d call typical.” I began frankly. “For starters, I was run through an unconventional combo of Basic Combat Training and Advanced Individual Training tailored just for this mission, while also taking class hours for stuff typically reserved for Officer Candidate School. BCT typically takes six months, followed by anywhere from six months to a year for AIT, but—”

“I meant the actual *contents* of your training, Emma.” Thalmin interjected, letting out a frustrated sigh as he did so.

“Oh, right, sorry. Yeah, so, most of it was accelerated BCT. So stuff like physical training, small arms weapons instruction and drilling—”

“Small arms?” Thalmin quickly interrupted.

“As you might expect, we have *a lot* of weapons types that have spawned over the years.” I pulled out my gun for emphasis. “The sheer variety of weapons required an equally diverse classification system in order to categorize them as a result. With small arms eventually coming to encompass any individual-use firearm that does not require the use of partially powered or fully powered exoskeletons to function to their fullest capability.” 

Thalmin blinked rapidly, before once more narrowing his eyes in suspicion.

“You mentioned *exoskeletons*.” Thalmin inquired sharply. “A-are you implying your people are in some way… *arachnous* or insectoid—”

“Oh, nonono. By exoskeletons, I basically mean this—” I paused, gesturing at my armor for emphasis. “It’s a complex system of… well… machines, basically. Machines that clamp all around a user in order to bolster and boost their strength by the power of mechanical force!” I beamed. “As such, what I meant was that there are some weapons that work functionally as small arms, but are only ever usable for individuals wearing some form of exoskeleton-assist kits.”

Thalmin’s suspicions didn’t *fully* subside however, though he seemed to just run with it for the time being.

“And what happens if one uses one of these weapons without the aid of an… *exoskeleton*?”

“The recoil will dislocate or break your shoulder and/or wrist.” I replied bluntly, causing the prince to blink rapidly in response.

“As you can imagine, firing a traditional chem-kinetic weapon comes with the caveat of *force* being generated. So… the larger the explosion in the gun, the more kickback you’ll expect.” I shrugged. 

“I see.” Thalmin responded slowly. “I… assume the next category up from ‘small arms’ to be ‘large’ arms, and perhaps ‘medium’ arms too, yes?”

“Erm…” I paused yet again, reaching for the back of my neck in preparation for the explanation to come. “The next ‘step up’ as it were, is actually *light weapons*.” 

That answer prompted the lupinor to simply stare at me blankly, his mouth curling up in a fit of confusion. 

“But we started with *small* arms—”

“The next step up following light weapons is *heavy* weapons, if that helps any.” I smiled awkwardly.

“*Of course it is*.” The prince acknowledged with a drained breath, gripping the bridge of his snout in the process. “I apologize for leading our conversation astray. I was not anticipating, nor at all ready, for another semantics lesson. To no fault of your own, of course.” The prince let out a polite sigh, before gesturing towards me with a single hand. “Let us return to our original line of discussion.”

“So, yeah, small arms training. I had plenty of that, along with light and heavy weapons training in accordance with my Advanced Power Armored Specialist, or APAS certification.” I inhaled deeply, steadying myself for a rapid-fire delivery of mil-spec jargon. “Then there was advanced equipment training because of the power armor, along with advanced electronic operation’s training as a baseline requisite, tactics and strategy training, battlefield drone and recon training, expedited forward operations training, and of course, there was also Close Quarters Combat, or CQC training.” 

While the lupinor’s attentiveness waned with each piece of jargon, it was that latter category that prompted Thalmin to perk up and chime in.

“And this… close quarters combat, I assume it is a sort of martial art?”

“Various martial arts distilled into a condensed package.” I nodded. “It draws from many ancient and modern disciplines, but with a core focus on surviving unarmed.” I continued methodically. “The first lesson, if anything, is preventative — consisting of tactics on how *not* to lose your primary in the first place.” 

“Your *primary* being your gun, correct?”

“Yup!” I nodded.

“Proceed.” The wolf urged.

“In addition to that first lesson, you got lessons on controlling your assailant during an all-out brawl; open hand strikes, knee strikes, anything and everything to get them off of you. Really, you’re not gunning to win a mixed martial arts match here. You’re more or less just trying to disengage ‘safely’ to the point where backup arrives or where you’re able to regain control of a weapon.” 

The lupinor’s features morphed from one of stoic intent to one drowning in thoughtful contemplation, his eyes beckoning some internal turmoil rumbling away beneath the surface.

“This sounds less like a tutelage on dueling, and more like instructions for when you’re driven to the last resort.” He offered with disappointment.

“Precisely.” I nodded. “The idea is that if you’ve reached a point where you’re left unarmed and *fighting*, then something’s already gone terribly wrong.”

Thalmin acknowledged this with a series of slow nods, his hand gripping the bottom of his snout as he did so.

“And… melee weapons?”

“Oh, right, there’s *this*.” I acknowledged with a nod, and a quick draw of the Mark XIV multipurpose combat and utility knife. “Fourth generation composalite with a leading monomolecular diamond edge.” 

Thalmin stared at the blade with a quirk of his brow, looking not too impressed by, well… everything about it.

However, that expression soon shifted to one of contemplative realization, returning to the very face he’d led this conversation with in the first place.

“So you really *have* abandoned the notion of melee weapons as a primary offensive tool.” He whispered under his breath, the implications of which prompted him to lock his gaze onto my pistol with increasing intensity. 

“Yeah. No offense to you and your arts, of course, but swords and melee weapons have been obsolete in our realm for the better part of a millennium.” I acknowledged frankly. “It’s just… no longer an effective killing tool. At least, not when stacked up against the sorts of weapons I’ve shown you.” I quickly added. “And in conflicts, that’s kinda what counts, right?” 

“Along with the capacity to maintain said weapons of war. Capability is meaningless without sustainability or scale.” Thalmin reasoned. “Though… if what you stated weeks ago was anything to go by…” He trailed off, allowing me to address *that* particular point. 

“Sustainability, logistics, and scale are the hallmarks of what makes modern warfare, well… *modern*.” I answered plainly. “So everything I said in that conversation wasn’t posturing, but an abject fact.” I shivered just referencing that conversation, especially given its preceding context — the null fight — was still as fresh in my mind as the day I’d faced it down. “There’s enough guns in my realm to arm every human currently living a hundred times over, and that’s not to mention the ammunition…”

“But surely that’s accumulative—”

“It is! But it wouldn’t really take too much to churn them out either. We have the industrial capacity to probably flood the entire surface of a realm in guns if we wanted to.” I paused, before letting out an awkward chuckle, once more reaching the back of my head awkwardly in order to defuse the situation. “That’s… not a hyperbole. Practically speaking, we *could* do it. But just because we *could* doesn’t mean we *will*.”

Thalmin’s face reflected the same ghostly visage he’d shown on that day, as his features quickly darkened along with his tone of voice. “But you *could*.”

“Yeah, we *could*. But like I said, we probably won’t have a *need* to.” I attempted to calm the situation down some. “I mean, unless the Nexus really gives us a reason to… but I doubt *that’ll* ever happen.” I offered sarcastically. 

To which Thalmin could only reply with a weary smile.

“So to confirm what you said previously, every soldier in your realm, every man-at-arms and void legionnaire, every sailor and flyer, all of them—”

“Go through some form of BCT, in which all of them are trained in the art of the gun, yeah.” I intercepted the man with a grin. 

Though it was clear his expressions were far less receptive, and more so mortified at the implications that came with this confirmation of what I’d only alluded to before.

“So you really have crossed the martial gap, all without once casting a single spell.” He reasoned, before once more narrowing his eyes. “And if your Void Diver Aunt is of any indication, not only have you crossed the gap in weapons, but likewise in conveyances too.”

“Yeah… but that’s a *whole* other story, Thalmin.” I chuckled darkly. “Suffice it to say, engagement distances in modern warfare aren't measured in meters, but in kilometers and then some.” 

That comment seemed to cause the man to shudder even moreso. “Snipers engage enemies kilometers out at a time, same for frontline drone operators, and I’m not even going to get into remote—”

“I see, Emma.” Thalmin interjected warily. “I see.” He sighed. 

A moment of silence punctuated our little back and forth, before he finally elongated his blade, forming the longsword I’d seen only a few times before.

“So you have mastered the manaless art of breaching the martial gap, creating entirely novel forms of not just weaponry, but the arts and industries required to sustain and maintain it all.” 

“Yup, that’s right.” I nodded proudly.

“Then I must ask… with what you currently have at your disposal, do you feel as if your tactics and strategies will be viable in the long term?”

“Yup! In fact, every piece of equipment I have with me was chosen just for that specific task. It’s the whole reason why they chose this specific model of armor to use as the base for my mission, despite it not being the most advanced or up-to-date. This logic extends to my gun, the ZNK-19, and every piece of tech I have with me. So the production of caseless ammo? Completely viable if not a non-issue whatsoever.” 

“But that requires the use of your larger equipment, no? Your tent, your… *manaless microfactoriums*.”

“Indeed.” I nodded.

“Our quest will take us away from these comforts of manaless logistics, Emma. And while I understand that you may take as much ammunition with you as possible, there always exists a possibility that it may simply not be enough. What then?” The mercenary prince posited, extending both of his arms in the process. “Your skills with the blade may prove more necessary than you initially expected, Emma.”

I paused, taking into consideration the lupinor’s words, as all of it *did* ring true to one of the many contingencies the IAS had anticipated.

“You do have a point, Thalmin.” I acknowledged.

“You were trained in the martial arts as a last resort, while I was trained in it as a first.” A daring smile formed across the lupinor’s face, the longsword suddenly crackling to light with a momentary surge of lightning.

“Let us humor this hypothetical scenario then, and see how you fare, yes?”

**Thalmin**

The moon… was a great *many* things to many different people.

To the old believers, it was the metaphysical embodiment of the ancestral plane, caught in an eternal battle between light and dark.

To the Nexus, it was an adjacent realm’s sole connection to the primavale — an umbilical through which matter and mana alike were drip-fed in an eternal cycle of death and rebirth.  

Whilst many bickered and argued over the minor and insignificant details of its nature, no one — not a single soul — had ever made the claim that it was in any way shape or form another *realm*.

A ‘realm’ for departed ancestors in the metaphysical context? Yes.

But a *tangible* realm of rock and stone? No.

Such ramblings belonged to the crazed sermons of the village idiot, or the town fool.

Substantiated only by the many revelations one could find at the bottom of a tankard of ale. 

And yet here I was.

A prince.

Of sound mind and steady mettle.

Actively considering the same ramblings, but with the pensiveness one would have to an oracle’s preachings. 

“Yes.” Emma replied confidently and with not an ounce of hesitation. “Or at least, in my reality it is. I’m not too sure about the Nexus. But here? Not only is the moon an entirely distinct realm, but every point in the night sky could also be considered a realm unto its own.” 

I did not know what to feel following that revelation.

I didn’t even know *how* to take that statement. Which, in any other situation… would’ve simply been a confirmation of one’s fractured mental state.

Questions abounded, alongside feelings, all of which tore at what I knew — or what I thought I knew.

My mind bounded to fill the gaps of this new paradigm. 

One that I *knew* was impossible… but that I rationalized *as* possible, not only out of Emma’s impossible proofs, but likewise out of Ilunor’s rationale.

Earthrealm… was a dead realm.

And this meant that *anything* was possible, given nothing was known of such a fundamentally *broken* place; of such a fundamentally… eerie and empty space.

My curiosity reached for questions I didn’t even have words for.

However, my focus eventually landed on a simple, tangible demand. 

One which I directed towards the reality-defying entity I called a friend. 

“Show me, then.” I announced tersely. “Show me this *realm* which floats amidst dead space, and show us the journey through which you established once and for all… that the *moon*… is in fact, a *realm*.” 

This ultimatum, which I assumed to be well received beneath the earthrealmer’s faceplate, likewise brought about an expression that I’d rarely seen on the princess thus far.

A look of restrained, yet visible, excitement. 

This stood in stark contrast to the Vunerian, who slunk further and further into abject dread.

I… knew not which camp to fall under.

For even in my most optimistic of projections did I find myself *uneasy* at the prospects of a prophecy made true — of the existence of a power that could truly attain the same heights as the Nexus.

Even *if* that power was as benevolent as Emma was intent on portraying. 

“The journey, huh?” Emma spoke under a lackadaisical tone of voice. “That’s actually a great idea\~” She continued, turning towards me with a slight *skip* in her step. 

An action completely *contrary* to the enigmatic world she belonged to.

The scene, expectedly, shifted once more. 

Away from the chrome ball and its incessant beeping.

Away from the gut-churning *nothingness* of the void beyond the nonexistent tapestry.

Far beneath the blue skies, and once more on solid earth.

More than that, we were once more thrust back towards the vast expansive steppes in which this ‘launch site’ was situated. One which seemed to be busier than it was in the previous firespear launch, with phantom humans donning grey and green uniforms bearing the sigil of peasants, interspersed between more humans carrying boxy equipment all aimed towards this new idol of their devotion.

Gone was the squat form of the previous firespear.

In its place, was a taller, much more imposing monolith. 

One which finally lived up to its moniker of ‘tower’. 

Though similar to its predecessor, it remained precariously shackled to the earth, with four arms of heavy steel and a tower of metal scaffolding seemingly *bracing* it from ascending prematurely. 

“Every mission you've seen up to this point in time has been unmanned.” Emma began confidently, before sheepishly correcting herself with a quick aside. “With the exception of Wan Hu, none have since attempted to reach the stars atop of these oversized firespears.” She continued, as she gestured towards a procession of vehicles, and a stream of humans who promptly entered a manaless ascender. “But all that changes today. As on this day, barely 58 years since we first took to the skies, do we now aim to shoot *beyond* it. To prove, once and for all, that man *can* and *will* pierce the heavens. To boldly go, in spite of the dangers, in spite of the risks, and even in spite of our destination’s inhospitality to all earthly life…” Emma paused abruptly, her voice stuttering in a rare moment of inexplicable thought. “All to see what lies beyond the next horizon.” 

Immediately following this did several figures emerge from the ascender, all crowding around an oddly-dressed human in a baggy and ill-fitting bright orange bodysuit.

“Because there will always be those amidst our ranks ready to put it all on the line. Those who would dare to push the boundaries, to answer the call of that most captivating of human callings  — the *need* for exploration. To *be*, and spirits forbid… to *die* a pioneer.”

*Foolishness*. I could hear my uncle responding, his voice echoing throughout the proving dens, loud enough to pierce through the rumbling of otherworldly machines and the sharp *clanking* of metal as the orange-suited human entered what looked to be a coffin.

*Brazenness for brazenness sakes, all for selfish ends.* 

*Selflessness and sacrifice with only the vaguest of callings is a waste to both clan and kin. A death should serve a tangible gain,* ***not*** *a vague ideal or ephemeral calling.*

“But when *brazenness* is shared amongst an entire *people*, to the point where all are willing to share in the cost and effort of fulfilling such a ‘foolish’ notion, is it at that point madness or brilliance?” I muttered to myself under a hushed breath, my focus fixated on the *calmness* of it all.

In spite of knowing that what might come next could spell disaster.

=====

**Thacea**

*58 years… barely a generation following their tentative grasp of flight… and here they were, seemingly* ***unsatisfied*** *with what should have been the greatest achievement of a landed flock.* I thought to myself, as ceremonies and pleasantries abounded before the suited human was promptly sealed within his metal coffin — a cramped space that looked more akin to a *torture* chamber than a vehicle.

The scene quickly shifted as we followed the descent of the remaining humans back towards the gathered crowd, and were once again treated to the sight of the firespear to its fullest extent.

However, unlike every other firespear launch thus far, there existed a gnawing, *uncomfortable* feeling welling up within me. A feeling which only intensified as I watched this *tower* standing idly in a thick swirling fog of its own breath.

A discomfort… born of the knowledge that unlike all prior launches — that this was no longer an oversized *toy* — but a *vehicle*.

As atop of it wasn’t a strange chrome ball, nor a memory shard, or even nothing at all.

No.

Atop of it now, nearly twenty stories above the ground, was a sapient being.

A person… who was knowingly putting himself atop of a tower of fire and flame.

All with the faintest of hopes of surviving a journey into an equally unwelcoming and hostile void.

*Sanity no longer applied*. I thought to myself. *For how could someone sane risk assured death—*

And then it clicked.

My eyes shifted sharply towards the prideful earthrealmer, who stood there explaining every excruciating detail behind this event.

A narrative quickly formed, as prior conversations now locked into place, and a renewed understanding of both Emma and her people manifested within my mind.

*“You could say we have a habit of making ourselves welcome in the most inhospitable of places. As just like those that have come before me, I now find myself exploring a reality that isn’t just inhospitable, but actively hostile to my very being.”*

I didn’t have to look any further to see this very brazenness in action.

As every waking second of Emma’s life was in and of itself, a testament to this same propensity for risk-taking taken to its ludicrous extreme.

*And yet she manages to persist, in spite of the knowledge, the understanding… that one small misstep could mean assured death*.

My mind raced, recalling stories of avinor harboring similar dispositions.

Stories of great explorers and intrepid pioneers, each risking wing and talon to explore the expanse of our globe.

Stories… whose themes felt so distant and ephemeral — incompatible within a post-Nexian reformation world.

Even if it was *once* our history.

But here?

That spirit felt *alive*. That sentiment, felt vicariously, through a completely foreign people.

Not only in the sight-seer that was rapidly approaching its climax, but also through the entity presenting it who I had taken a kinship to.

“—his name was then-Senior Lieutenant Yuri Gagarin.” The earthrealmer’s voice finally came through, amidst my own thoughts that seemed louder than they ever had been. “And on this day, did he fulfil the hopes of dreamers and pioneers stretching back millenia.” 

*THWWWOOOSHHHHHHH!* 

Came the cacophonous rumbling of the firespear’s flame, as massive streams of fire erupted from beneath the tower, bathing the plinth and the empty space beneath it in the raw and unbridled fury of a dragon’s scornful wrath. 

So loud was the continuous *thrum* of explosions that the release of its four massive anchors barely registered. 

Slowly did the tower rise, ascending against all known conventions, defying leypull with the fury of a dauntless people.

A people who, by all conventional wisdom, shouldn’t have ever attained speeds beyond that of a tamed beast of burden.

And yet here they were.

Riding atop of the power of tamed *explosions*.

The scene shifted once more, now split into three.

To our left was the compound, and the humans who now looked onwards towards the skies.

To our middle was the trailing perspective of the craft itself, triggering notes of exhilaration and nausea in equal measures.

And finally, to our right, was a sight from within the coffin itself, showing a man seemingly helpless atop of a tomb of his kin’s own making.

I watched on with inextricable focus, my eyes monitoring the man’s movements under the strains that would naturally come from such immense speeds.

“What speeds must he tolerate to breach the skies, Emma?” I finally inquired, watching on as the skies began to inexplicably… *thin*.

“Just under five miles…” Emma paused, as if purposefully teasingly. “*Per second*.”

It took me a moment to register that in relative terms I could visually conceive of.

But once I did… I was once more left dumbfounded.

The same could be said for Thalmin and Ilunor, as silence dominated most of the journey up, with the firespear going through the same motions as its predecessor, segmenting and separating, until all that was left was an odd-looking spheroid object sat atop of a brown cylinder I’d hazard to even call an *enclosure*, let alone a *vehicle*.

It was at this point however, did the right-most image come to dominate our view.

As we looked on, from the perspective of the cramped and unseemly cockpit, towards a porthole that displayed not just endless skies or clouds… but the skies… as seen from the perspective of an Old God. 

The skies… as seen from *above*.

Not within.

And certainly not below.

But *above*.

The former sight-seers *had* been clearer about this.

But to see it from the perspective of a human, a manaless being with little individual capacity other than a thinking mind and two dexterous hands, was beyond breathtaking.

“This undertaking wouldn’t have been possible without everyone back home too.” Emma interrupted abruptly, displaying once more, the rows upon rows of conservatively-dressed featureless phantoms crowding behind machines of blinking lights and tables with papers strewn-about. “And not just the thinkers, but the builders and everyone else responsible for actually *constructing* everything it took to reach this point.” She continued, quickly showing sights familiar to me from our very first night together — metal foundries, and immense forges of impossible size and scale.

At least, impossible for a *newrealmer*.

“Alone, you may not be capable of much.” Thalmin began, taking all of us by surprise. “A sole human, seems to only be capable of lofty ambitions and admittedly *persuasive* words. But it takes a village, a town, a city and an entire *kingdom*, to achieve those dreams.”

“Well-said, Thalmin. Moreover, it’s another thing entirely as well, to mobilize the political will and economic capital to achieve said ends.” Emma acknowledged, as we watched as the craft continued on its lonely voyage through nothing.

A few more moments of silence passed before the craft began firing its ‘engines’ to seemingly no effect. Though its ineffectualness was misleading, as it indeed began its descent, reentering the skies where it attempted to shear apart its lower cylindrical segment, only to find itself *tethered* by a flimsy set of umbilicals that Emma explained as ‘*unplanned, but thankfully, self-resolving’*. The umbilicals eventually tore apart, leaving only its chrome orb to descend further, before a sharp explosion marked the expulsion of none other than its occupant — the man now floating precariously back down to the surface with the aid of a parachute attached to his seat.

Following which, moments after his landing, did he approach two more humans before Thalmin followed up with a question I hadn’t anticipated.

“Emma.”

“Yes, Thalmin?”

“I’m assuming… from what we saw *beyond* the skies, that the man *didn’t* just enter the void, only to return, like a stone thrown straight upwards?”

“Nope! He actually *orbited* the globe, circling it from above, *once*!” Emma announced with glee.

“And your world… it is not *small*, is it?”

“It’s just under twenty-five thousand miles in circumference, but I’m not sure how that stacks to most realms—”

“Puny for the Nexus.” Ilunor finally re-entered the conversation. 

“But *average* for an adjacent realm.” I countered.

“And how long did it take for this man to circumnavigate your globe from beyond the skies?” Thalmin pressed onwards, unbothered by either of our responses. 

“A hundred-and-eight minutes. So, just under two hours!” Emma responded gleefully once more.

Though strangely, the lupinor didn’t seem to share in this same joyous and boisterous of attitudes.

=====

**Thalmin**

One hour… and forty-eight minutes.

Five miles per second.

I didn’t need the scholarly acumen of my sisters to understand the implications of such numbers.

For the practical, and most importantly the martial implications, behind such capabilities wasn’t just impressive.

It was **frightening**.

To be able to ascend into the void, only to drop right back down from the *skies*, was a crude but horrifying mirror to the Nexus’ instantaneous teleportation.

My mind was now filled to the brim with the sheer number of possibilities brought about by such a novel vehicle.

From the deployment of whole battalions, all dropping from the skies.

To the delivery of *weapons*.

Weapons similar in destructive potential to the explosive power of Emma’s crate.

Weapons… perhaps even *more powerful* than that.

Just under two hours — for a kingdom to be able to strike anywhere on a planet with impunity.

Barely a town cryer’s second gallop — for a ruler to deploy his forces, his armies, his soldiers and his weapons of destruction — to rain hellfire if need be.

And this was merely fifty-eight years following their first flight into the skies.

=====

**Ilunor**

“And I assume your initial successes led to even greater and greater accomplishments without *one* inkling of failure, hmm?” I countered, observing, analyzing, digging into every available crack and crevice in this rose-tinted look into the earthrealmer’s past.

“Not at all, Ilunor.” The suited figure admitted. “If anything, close calls were more common than clean missions. And more than that, I’d be remiss if I didn’t acknowledge the lives lost over our race for the stars.”

What appeared to be a list of names manifested in front of us, alongside sight-seers of firespears either exploding upon their plinths, or breaking apart in mid-air.

The sights of which put the warehouse explosion to shame, giving even the usually stoic Thalmin pause for thought.

Throughout the scrolling of names, Emma stood still, announcing out of some respect for her ancestors a moment of silence. “This is the least I can do to honor their sacrifices. To never forget the human cost of progress.” Was her reasoning, which could’ve just as easily been misconstrued as some misguided form of reverence.

“We don’t claim to be perfect, Ilunor. If anything, I’ve shown you just thow many setbacks and tragedies we did have prior to this point. And while the causes of these tragic losses ranged from inexplicable malfunctions to gross negligence of those in charge, to even design flaws and oversights — we continued to press onwards. Some of us learned from our mistakes, and some of us not so much. But in any case, I… believe we should move forwards towards our original question, starting first with the fulfilment of Thalmin’s request.”

=====

**Thalmin**

Just as quickly as my concerns over Emma’s people were reaching its precipice, was I placated by an unexpected source — her honorable decision to respect her ancestors’ sacrifices through action.

An action which may not entirely *define* her leaders, but demonstrated at the very least, a strong sense of moral *character* in the candidate they chose to represent them.

Following which, we were once again thrust into another locale.

However, unlike the vast steppes of the prior location, we were instead brought to a tropical idyllic beach, with lush and verdant greenery interspersed between commanding and imposing buildings.

Gone was the hammer and sickle that dominated much of the prior location’s structures and people.

Instead, it was replaced by two banners. One bearing some strange house sigil of a blue orb with two sloppily drawn squiggles interrupting its interior, complete with four foreign letters that more than likely belonged to some upstart house too insecure to rely on symbology alone to represent their clan. Next, was a far more *novel* but *simple* banner, consisting of a series of red and white stripes complete with a canton of some fifty or so stars at its upper left hand corner.

Together, I likened this to be some writ between house and kingdom, some industrious endeavor. 

Regardless, I watched as Emma positioned us by the single largest building within this compound.

A towering monolith in and of itself, with doors that seemed better suited for the mythical giants of old, rather than any living mortal.

These doors, slowly and with great effort, opened up to reveal a massive room with an interior dominated by a complicated mess of metal pipes and bracings, with hundreds of phantom humans sporting overalls and white-coats, all crowding around elevated platforms behind what was first shown to us at the beginning of the museum of firespears.

One of the single most tallest and elegant-looking firespears of all.

One that stretched higher up than the tallest building in Havenbrock.

One that could easily rival the inner-ring steeples within the Isle of Towers, and perhaps even the outer-ring of the Nexus’ crownlands.

What Emma would promptly refer to as—

“The Saturn V rocket.” She beamed proudly. 

This immense monolith slowly began its *crawl* towards its plinth, atop of a tracked vehicle that moved *slower* than Prince Talnin’s laziest crawls.

The sight seer took this opportunity to position us close by, as Emma began gesturing at the behemoth that we *strained upwards* to look at.

“The most powerful rocket of its century, with a thrust capacity *ten times* that of the firespear that took Yuri Gagarin to space.” Emma paused, gesturing towards its lower segment, as the sight-seer took us towards what looked to be massive conical *shafts*. “Powered by five massive F-1 engines, each individually larger than the V-2s I showed earlier.” I stared blankly, my eyes attempting to bring about some rhyme and reason to the magnitude of these… *engines*. 

More than that, Emma was quick to provide a cutaway of the interior of the first ‘section’ of the tower, revealing that within it wasn’t cargo or passengers, but once again — fuel. 

Combustible liquids stored as high up as a 12-story building, fueling ‘engines’ the size of a rural commoner’s hut. 

I didn’t speak.

Not even as Emma went further *up* the ‘stack’, towards the ‘second’ section of the massive tower, with fuel and engines only *marginally smaller* than the ‘first’ section; a *seven*\-story height fueling *carriage-sized* engines. 

The ludicrousness of this entire display was too much to bear.

But that was when the tone of the sight-seer took an unexpected turn.

As we were taken away from the verdant grasses and idyllic beaches of this compound, and instead, thrust towards a manufactorium. The sight-seer physically moving to cross the distances involved this time around, as if to emphasize the sheer scale of this undertaking.

“This wasn’t just the work of a single individual, or even a group of individuals.” Emma began, as we moved, manufactorium to manufactorium, each assembling either unrecognizable parts or the staple features of the monolith we’d just witnessed. “This was an undertaking that took a *nation* to build. With experts from countless industries, and cooperation between rival companies, all in order to build the behemoth that was the Saturn V, plate by plate, and bolt by bolt.”

We criss-crossed what appeared to be an expansive continent, crossing through grassy steppes, snowy mountains, great canyons, and through rivers and settlements of all shapes and sizes… visiting not only manufactoriums now, but scholarly offices, Nexian-sized forges, and places I couldn’t even put into words. All of this, across paved roads and ‘rail’ spanning a *continent*.

We eventually found ourselves back at the beach-side compound, now positioned amidst a crowd gathered a fair distance away from the firespear itself.

The crowds, similar to Gagarin’s launch into the void, carried with them boxes and tools of all sorts, all pointed towards the firespear.

“A million eyes were trained on the launch site that day, and tens of millions more through the memory shards delivering live images of the launch to people from around the globe.” Emma began, as picture upon picture emerged across the sight-seer. 

“I’m showing you a live feed of everything happening concurrently that day. From the three astronauts — Armstrong, Collins, and Aldrin — making their way up to the command module.” 

Emma paused, showing the three men in question in suits of white and rounded glass helmets, as they approached their tomb-like enclosure. 

“To mission control and the hundreds of people working around the clock to ensure the complex  systems needed for such an endeavor worked as intended.” 

Another picture emerged, displaying a room of row upon row of machines, and the phantom-like humans behind them. 

“To the various technicians, engineers, and support staff all working tirelessly until the very last minute.” Tens more images emerged, of hundreds of humans toiling about various inexplicable tasks, all at the service of this cathedral of iron and steel. 

However just as all of these concurrent images appeared, did they quickly fade as the sight-seer once more leveled its sights not too far from the plinth, amidst the crowd of onlookers.

Following which, did foreign words under a muffled filter begin what I assumed to be a countdown.

*“T-Minus fifteen seconds, guidance is internal… eleven… ten.. nine.”* 

As second, after second, did my heart beat to the tune of this moment.

*“Ignition sequence starts.”* 

A moment marked by an explosion that put all others to shame.

*“Six, five, four, three, two, one, zero, all engines running.”* 

As flames and ferocious smoke swept beneath the plinth, only to erupt back *up* towards the towering behemoth. 

Fire *burned* ferociously beneath the tower, as smoke continued to rise.

For a moment, I feared the worst as the sights and sounds of failed missions flashed across my mind.

However, only a second after that thought, did the tower begin to rise.

*“Liftoff, we have liftoff! Thirty-two minutes past the hour. Liftoff of Apollo 11.”*

I watched… as forty-stories worth of iron and steel lifted off of its plinth, rising faster and faster and in such a way that one could easily forget that this object, this… *craft*, wasn’t ever supposed to take flight.

*THRRRWWWOOOSHHMMMMMM!!!*

But fly it did, as it ascended, its engines, its metal, pulsing, as if gasping and breathing. 

Throughout it all, as the seconds turned into minutes, and as the craft made it through that invisible layer between the skies and the void, Emma remained silent.

Simply allowing the various muffled and filtered voices of humans long since dead to speak on her behalf.

Not a single voice sounded the least bit *panicked*.

Even excitement itself felt difficult to discern.

As every single person seemed uncharacteristically calm.

Calm…  whilst riding atop of a continuous stream of unending flame.

Nobody else spoke, or dared interrupt the pioneers as they left the confines of the skies, eschewing tower after towering ‘sections’,  leaving barely a *stump* by the time they’d entered the void proper.

It was only after the last section remained floating listlessly, did Thacea finally speak.

=====

**Thacea**

“Emma?”

“Yes, Thacea?”

“How *large* is your moon?”

“Just under sixty-eight-hundred miles in circumference, give or take. About a quarter the size of our planet, for scale.” 

My mind ceased, if only for a moment, as the leypull of the situation once more dawned on me.

My suspicions… were proven true.

Whether for better or for worse.

And given Emma’s lack of a followup response, it was clear that she understood exactly what sorts of thoughts had since entered my mind.

“What is all this fuss about the size of these hypothetical realms, princess?” Ilunor interrupted, his voice as terse as it was uneasy. 

“It’s a matter of distance and perspective, Ilunor.” I replied simply, garnering a look of confusion from the man. “If the moon truly is a realm of such dimensions, for it to be as *small* as it is in the night sky, implies that the distances involved are nothing short of…”

“Astronomical, yeah.” Emma interjected with a prideful acknowledgement. 

“Exactly *how far away* is the moon, Emma?” Thalmin interrupted, his features stoic, masking the uneasy undercurrents just beneath the surface.

“Just under two-hundred and thirty-nine thousand miles.” Emma announced plainly, simply, and without hesitation.

“How long did it take—”

“Oh, if you’re concerned about us staying here for days on end, don’t worry. I’m just about to skip to the good stuff in fact. But if you’re wondering about specifics? It took just about 4 days to reach the moon, at a cruising speed of about 4223 feet per second.” 

My beak hung agape, as my eyes were transfixed on the vast empty darkness that dominated this… space between realms.

Whilst other realms were divided by the fabric of reality itself.

Earthrealm… was removed from its contemporaries, by sheer *distance*.

*Impossible distances*.

Yet distances that were once again breached not by solutions that bridged the gap, but by the brute-forcing of the most obvious of solutions, that *should not* have been practical.

And so it was, that in this sea of absolute nothing, did this craft barely the size of a small house, approach its final destination.

The moon.

=====

**Thalmin**

The journey had been accelerated, all for the sake of practicality.

However, as I watched the moon grow closer, expanding to encompass my field of vision… I was met with a throat-clenching impasse.

This… ethereal place… *shouldn’t have existed*.

This realm of ancestors and mana, of primavalic energies and intangible light, shouldn’t have been reachable.

It shouldn’t be *tangible*.

I watched in disbelief as this cumbersome craft of steel made its awkward descent towards the surface of what was once just a dot in the sky.

I watched… as those flimsy legs made *contact* with white rock and stone.

*“Houston, tranquility base here. The eagle has landed.”* 

I listened, as the voices of humans rang out within an infinite dark, atop of a realm that wasn’t theirs.

I grappled with the reality of the situation… as best as I could. The reality that I had to remind myself, was in fact possible, owing to the existence of a *dead realm*.

More time flew by now, as images from within the cabin showed these pioneers preparing for the ultimate ends of this mission.

It showed, following some awkward shuffling in exiting the craft, one of these ‘astronauts’ donning a thick suit of white — leaving towards a set of ladders built into the side of the craft.

I cocked my head for a moment, my eyes landing on Emma’s thickly-suited form, and that of her ancestor.

And in that moment, did I realize the amusing connection that came with human exploration — the necessity for protection of an otherwise weak and fragile form. Along with the nerves of steel that must have come with such a precarious endeavor.

Following which, did my eyes once more focus on her ancestor, as the man awkwardly shuffled down the ladder, his booted feet touching down on a dusty and desolate wasteland that stretched ominously into the void-filled skies.

“That’s one small step for \[a\] man, one giant leap for mankind.” He spoke in a foreign tongue, his words translated into High Nexian text beneath his person. 

After which, did Emma finally speak.

“1969. 66 years after we first took to the skies, and eight years after we first breached it. The year we achieved the impossible. The year we first set foot upon a celestial body.” 

“A realm unto its own.” Thacea spoke, her voice restraining the shock welling within.

“A realm… of what exactly?” Ilunor piped up abruptly. “Of rock and dust?! Of white-sanded deserts?! Perhaps later you will come to find a lush paradise, perhaps an oasis? Perhaps something that is befitting of this location’s namesake? What was it? The *sea of tranquility?*” 

“Well, no, Ilunor. This is more or less all you’re going to get from the moon.” Emma explained, gesturing around her as her ancestors began fiddling with their manaless tools.

“So this was an exercise in futility then? Expending your resources for the sake of reaching a barren wasteland?” Ilunor shot back, before lifting up a finger. “You know, earthrealmer. This is why the Nexus actually *identifies* pleasant and palatable worlds before exploring them, at least when we aren’t too busy exploring our own infinitely expanding plane. But… given the limiting *nature* of your inter-realm *travel*, it seems like you lack that luxury.” He began *snickering*, garnering a frustrated sigh from Emma who quickly brought up another picture, set against the darkness of the sight-seer.

“I can see where you’re coming from, Ilunor. I understand that to a Nexian, this endeavor must feel like a waste of resources.” Emma paused, garnering a self-satisfied nod from Ilunor. “But not to us. Because where you see endless expanses of nothing, we see a *future*. A future not beholden to the limitations of today. Because if nature proves not to be forthcoming, then we’ll simply *build* a nature of our own. A nature we can design, control, and adorn to our whims; to our *comfort*. However, even disregarding *all of that*, we chose to go to the moon not because of a desire to exploit or expand. Instead, we chose to go to it because it was the next logical leap forward.”

Emma redirected her gaze towards the floating image, of what I assumed to be a human leader standing behind a podium, above a crowd of gathered humans.

*“But why, some say, the Moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may as well ask, why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? We choose to go to the moon in this decade and to do other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win.”*

**Winner**|*Martyr!*|Kaveh Akbar|Cyrus Shams is a young man grappling with an inheritance of violence and loss: his mother’s plane was shot down over the skies of Tehran in a senseless accident; and his father’s life in America was circumscribed by his work killing chickens at a factory farm in the Midwest. Cyrus is a drunk, an addict, and a poet, whose obsession with martyrs leads him to examine the mysteries of his past—toward an uncle who rode through Iranian battlefields dressed as the Angel of death to inspire and comfort the dying, and toward his mother, through a painting discovered in a Brooklyn art gallery that suggests she may not have been who or what she seemed.|/u/thnkurluckystars
**1st Runner-Up**|*Annie Bot*|Sierra Greer|Annie Bot was created to be the perfect girlfriend for her human owner, Doug.

True, she’s not the greatest at keeping Doug’s place spotless, but she’s trying to please him. She’s trying hard. She’s learning, too. Doug says he loves that Annie’s artificial intelligence makes her seem more like a real woman, but the more human Annie becomes, the less perfectly she behaves. As Annie's relationship with Doug grows more intricate and difficult, she starts to wonder whether Doug truly desires what he says he does. In such an impossible paradox, what does Annie owe herself?|/u/ehchvee

But according to her friends, her much-improved decor, and the photos on her phone, they’ve been together for years. As Lauren tries to puzzle out how she could be married to someone she can’t remember meeting, Michael goes to the attic to change a lightbulb and abruptly disappears. In his place, a new man emerges, and a new, slightly altered life re-forms around her. Realizing that her attic is creating an infinite supply of husbands, Lauren confronts the question: If swapping lives is as easy as changing a lightbulb, how do you know you’ve taken the right path? When do you stop trying to do better and start actually living?|/u/dmd19

The feud began a hundred years ago when Miles’s great-great-grandfather, Saint Abernathy, incited a miners’ rebellion that ended with a public execution at the hands of law enforcement. Now, Miles becomes the feud’s latest victim as the sheriff’s son and his friends sniff out the evidence, follow him through the woods, and beat him nearly to death. In the hospital, the ghost of a soot-covered man hovers over Miles’s bedside while Sheriff Davies threatens Miles into silence. But when Miles accidentally kills one of the boys who hurt him, he learns of other folks in Twist Creek who want out from under the sheriff’s heel.

**Winner**|*Funny Story*|Emily Henry|Daphne always loved the way her fiancé, Peter, told their story. How they met (on a blustery day), fell in love (over an errant hat), and moved back to his lakeside hometown to begin their life together. He really was good at telling it... right up until the moment he realized he was actually in love with his childhood best friend Petra. Which is how Daphne begins her new story: stranded in beautiful Waning Bay, Michigan, without friends or family but with a dream job as a children’s librarian (that barely pays the bills), and proposing to be roommates with the only person who could possibly understand her predicament: Petra’s ex, Miles Nowak. Scruffy and chaotic—with a penchant for taking solace in the sounds of heart break love ballads—Miles is exactly the opposite of practical, buttoned-up Daphne, whose coworkers know so little about her they have a running bet that she’s either FBI or in witness protection. The roommates mainly avoid one another, until one day, while drowning their sorrows, they form a tenuous friendship and a plan. If said plan also involves posting deliberately misleading photos of their summer adventures together, well, who could blame them?|/u/vanastalem
**1st Runner-Up**|*Just for the Summer*|Abby Jimenez|Justin has a curse, and thanks to a Reddit thread, it's now all over the internet. Every woman he dates goes on to find their soul mate the second they break up. When a woman slides into his DMs with the same problem, they come up with a plan: They'll date each other and break up. Their curses will cancel each other’s out, and they’ll both go on to find the love of their lives. It’s a bonkers idea… and it just might work. Emma hadn't planned that her next assignment as a traveling nurse would be in Minnesota, but she and her best friend agree that dating Justin is too good of an opportunity to pass up, especially when they get to rent an adorable cottage on a private island on Lake Minnetonka. It's supposed to be a quick fling, just for the summer. But when Emma's toxic mother shows up and Justin has to assume guardianship of his three siblings, they're suddenly navigating a lot more than they expected–including catching real feelings for each other. What if this time Fate has actually brought the perfect pair together?|/u/No_Pen_6114
**2nd Runner-Up**|*The Wedding People*|Alison Espach|It’s a beautiful day in Newport, Rhode Island, when Phoebe Stone arrives at the grand Cornwall Inn wearing a green dress and gold heels, not a bag in sight, alone. She's immediately mistaken by everyone in the lobby for one of the wedding people, but she’s actually the only guest at the Cornwall who isn’t here for the big event. Phoebe is here because she’s dreamed of coming for years—she hoped to shuck oysters and take sunset sails with her husband, only now she’s here without him, at rock bottom, and determined to have one last decadent splurge on herself. Meanwhile, the bride has accounted for every detail and every possible disaster the weekend might yield except for, well, Phoebe and Phoebe's plan—which makes it that much more surprising when the two women can’t stop confiding in each other.|/u/SweetAd5242

**Winner**|*The Message*|Ta-Nehisi Coates|Ta-Nehisi Coates originally set off to write a book about writing, in the tradition of Orwell’s classic Politics and the English Language, but found himself grappling with deeper questions about how our stories—our reporting and imaginative narratives and mythmaking—expose and distort our realities. Written at a dramatic moment in American and global life, this work from one of the country’s most important writers is about the urgent need to untangle ourselves from the destructive nationalist myths that shape our world—and our own souls—and embrace the liberating power of even the most difficult truths.|/u/marmeemarmee
**1st Runner-Up**|*Challenger: A True Story of Heroism and Disaster on the Edge of Space*|Adam Higginbotham|On January 28, 1986, just seventy-three seconds into flight, the space shuttle Challenger broke apart over the Atlantic Ocean, killing all seven people on board. Millions of Americans witnessed the tragic deaths of a crew including New Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe. Like 9/11 or JFK’s assassination, the Challenger disaster is a defining moment in 20th-century history—yet the details of what took place that day, and why, have largely been forgotten. Until now. Based on extensive archival records and meticulous, original reporting, Challenger follows a handful of central protagonists—including each of the seven members of the doomed crew—through the years leading up to the accident, a detailed account of the tragedy itself, and into the investigation that followed. It’s a tale of optimism and promise undermined by political cynicism and cost-cutting in the interests of burnishing national prestige; of hubris and heroism; and of an investigation driven by leakers and whistleblowers determined to bring the truth to light. Throughout, there are the ominous warning signs of a tragedy to come, recognized but then ignored, and ultimately kept from the public.|/u/caughtinfire
**2nd Runner-Up**|*Nuclear War: A Scenario*|Annie Jacobsen|Every generation, a journalist has looked deep into the heart of the nuclear military establishment: the technologies, the safeguards, the plans, and the risks. These investigations are vital to how we understand the world we really live in—where one nuclear missile will beget one in return, and where the choreography of the world’s end requires massive decisions made on seconds’ notice with information that is only as good as the intelligence we have. Pulitzer Prize finalist Annie Jacobsen’s Nuclear War: A Scenario explores this ticking-clock scenario, based on dozens of exclusive new interviews with military and civilian experts who have built the weapons, have been privy to the response plans, and have been responsible for those decisions should they have needed to be made. Nuclear War: A Scenario examines the handful of minutes after a nuclear missile launch. It is essential reading, and unlike any other book in its depth and urgency.|/u/MartagonofAmazonLily

Every day, its residents gather in the dining room to imbibe the hallucinogenic local liqueur, to obsess over money and status, and to discuss the great issues of the day: Will there be war?

Later that day, he would meet the emperor Moctezuma in a collision of two worlds, two empires, two languages, two possible futures. Cortés was accompanied by his nine captains, his troops, and his two translators: Friar Aguilar, a taciturn, former slave, and Malinalli, a strategic, former princess. Greeted at a ceremonial welcome meal by the steely princess Atotoxli, sister and wife of Moctezuma, the Spanish nearly bungle their entrance to the city. As they await their meeting with Moctezuma – who is at a political, spiritual, and physical crossroads, and relies on hallucinogens to get himself through the day and in quest for any kind of answer from the gods – the Spanish are ensconced in the labyrinthine palace. Soon, one of Cortés’s captains, Jazmín Caldera, overwhelmed by the grandeur of the city, begins to question the ease with which they were welcomed into the city, and wonders at the risks of getting out alive, much less conquering the empire.|/u/AccordingRow8863

I found myself in a part of the castle that just physically could *not* exist.

The EVI, and every sensor it had, was completely at odds with the reality that the gargoyle had led us into.

Because despite the countless hours of walking I’d done, and despite the meticulous mapping the EVI had carried out during all those hours, the space we had just stepped into just did not align with the geometries of what should exist in this section of the castle.

At least not what standard euclidean geometries would allow.

Physics, geometry, and my frazzled EVI aside, the hallways I was being led through were *distinctly* different from the ones I’d navigated thus far. The marble here was somehow *brighter*, same with the walls that looked as if they’d been carved out of a single piece of solid rock. The whole place gave me 3D printed, or factory-molded vibes, but without the minor imperfections that would’ve come with it.

As we made our way further and further still, stark white was becoming a constant theme, as each successive hall I was led to became increasingly brighter. Shadows began disappearing first, followed by what little textures remained, before leaving only the distinct outlines of the shapes that made up the walls. Eventually, nothing but the rough outlines remained, making me feel like I was walking through an unfinished art piece with just inked linework, or an unprocessed 3D render.

It felt like I was in a psychedelic music video at points.

Eventually, we made it out of the stark white, and back into something that more resembled the Academy I knew. In fact, it looked a bit *older* than the castle I had started to get used to.

The walls here were a mix of solid obsidian and a patterned marble, the floors were of a certain rock that felt *hollow* to walk on. More and more, the abstract art of the castle began to shift into sculptures of actual people. The paintings on the wall likewise started coming to life, as many moved about on their own, seemingly oblivious to the world that stood right in front of them.

It took a solid thirty minutes of walking, but eventually, we arrived at an absurdly large set of doors, in the middle of a part of a castle that no longer resembled the one I knew.

“Cadet Emma Booker, your newrealmer status prompts me to inform you of the Expectant Academic Decorum. You are to use these door knockers to knock on the door three successive times, in intervals of exactly three seconds. Do you understand these terms?” The gargoyle finally broke the silence that had only been interrupted during the half an hour walk by the *clacking* of metal boots on marble and stone floors. His gravely, artificial voice breaking through the unnerving silence that dominated this space.

“Affirmative.” Was my go-to answer, as I steadied myself in front of those doors, reaching for the two large *glowing* metal rings on either side of it. “Here goes nothing…” I mumbled to myself behind my speakers as I went ahead with the motions, generating a gong-like noise that reverberated throughout the halls.

Seconds passed.

Then an entire minute.

Time in this lifeless place just passed *slower*, especially when you had a constant timer ticking away, reminding you of each and every second that passed.

It took a whopping five minutes before the doors finally creaked open, revealing an office that both looked exactly what I expected, yet was as fittingly bizarre as this whole non-euclidean wing of the castle.

The furnishings, decor, wallpaper, and color scheme all looked strikingly Victorian. Browns and greens dominated the space, as did reds and blacks, with plush seats and endless bookshelves dotting the massive space. In between those were sculptures and busts of predominantly elves, interrupted occasionally by what looked to be aquatic-like mamallians, and even the odd cat-person here and there.

Yet it was the expansiveness of the place that really threw me off, the sheer scale of it, as it was clear that half of this office was built for one very *eccentric* purpose; a purpose which loomed overhead ominously, unwaveringly, and worst of all… animatedly. Soaring in frozen place above the office with its wings outstretched was a dragon, or more specifically, a dragon that had been systematically dissected into varying states of dissection. Starting with its tail which was nothing but bleached, stark-white bones, flowing into its midsection consisting of pinkish-red muscle and sinew, before finally ending off at its head which was completely intact with black and blue scales that still *pulsated* with life. In fact, its entire head was still *animated*, as its features were locked in a permanent expression of what I could only describe as shock. Its two copper eyes were fixed forward with the determined gaze of a warrior engaged in combat, and only once for what felt like a split second did it actually register my presence. Though this was short lived.

I couldn’t tell if this was a twisted war trophy, or whether this was just another one of the self-proclaimed *light mage’s* projections. Whatever the truth was, I just really hoped it wasn’t alive, and if it was… I hoped it wasn’t in pain.

The dragon itself took up the space of a commercial shuttle, which forced me to walk a good seven hundred or so feet before I was even close to making out Mal’tory standing idly by his desk. His back was faced towards me, whilst his front remained transfixed on a view outside the window. A view which seemed to imply that we were still somewhere within one of the upper rungs of the castle’s many towers, as I could just about see the cluster of lights that made up the town which sat at the foot of the lake formed by the waterfall underneath the castle.

“Cadet Emma Booker.” Mal’tory spoke with a disinterested tone of voice, yet still managed to emphasize, enunciate, and punctuate each and every syllable in my name with a sardonic beat and rhythm. “Scarcely enough time has elapsed for the ink of your signature to dry, and yet your name finds itself quickly becoming *engraved* within the tapestry of discourse.” The man paused, letting out a barely audible sigh as he maintained his course, refusing to face me eye to eye. “Are we so eager now, to become part of the Academy’s lore? Have we a fire and a passion so strong that we eschew harmony for discord? Is this the norm for what might be expected from Earthrealm? Or is the candidate of Earthrealm so brazen in her personal desires for notoriety that she loses sight of the candidacy she represents?”

I remained silent, refusing to respond. This seemed to finally prompt the man to shift his course, as he turned around slowly, revealing a crystal ball cradled between both his hands. “Your tongue, Cadet Emma Booker. Shall I remind you that you have one to speak with?” The man continued, neither his ash-gray complexion nor his yellow eyes once betraying even a sliver of emotion, despite his choice of words so evidently hinting at his open disdain.

“Professor Mal’tory.” I parrotted the man’s acknowledgement of my presence, but without any of the disinterested dismissiveness that he himself had used, choosing to go instead with *UN bureau-speak*; a tone of voice synonymous with the ‘de-facto’ way most government employees and politicians spoke back home. It was a weird mix that landed somewhere between professional and polite with a dash of civil-service-rep-agent courteousness sprinkled in. “Thank you for granting my request for this meeting. Considering the promptness and the timing, I have to give credit where credit’s due, for giving this issue the attention and urgency it deserves.” I finally began, opening up the line of diplomatic dialogue without responding to any of the jabs he’d laid out as bait. “We have a lot to discuss, and not a lot of time to do so.” I continued, as I started laying out each and every one of my cards. “I understand there has been a certain level of misunderstanding between both of our parties, and I would like to state for the record that it was not my intent nor my wish to cause any unnecessary trouble. It is my aim tonight to reach a suitable compromise that satisfies both of our parties, and is in the best interests of all other parties inextricably involved.” I spoke as plainly but as politely as I could, following the SIOP’s diplomatic dialogue to a T.

*Polite introduction.*

*Establish realistic aims and goals.*

*Emphasize mutual interests and a desire for cooperative dialogue.*

*Maintain non-confrontational and non-accusatory language.*

*Wait for reciprocation and proceed as appropriate.*

“And pray tell, what *other* parties are inextricably involved in our little parley?” The man shot back without ever once addressing any of my other talking points; subverting the whole point of a UN-style dialogue. Though part of me *was* hoping for this outcome, because it allowed me to fast-track this conversation toward a trajectory I wanted it to head to.

“The innocent parties that are blissfully unaware of the nature of the danger which lies in wait, Professor.” I began slowly, sternly, making sure not to leave any room for misinterpretation. “The parties that may or may not be involved with this whole affair in the first place. The students, staff, faculty, or any would-be bystander whose only crime would be their physical proximity to the crate when the inevitable arrives.” I took another breath, making sure the stakes were laid out before I established the threat, making it as clear as could be for the mage. “The inevitable outcome which I have described to the apprentice in length: a destructive force triggered by a mechanism designed explicitly with the intent to destroy. A rapid and uncontrolled release of energy. An explosion, Professor Mal’tory. One that will activate either when a certain amount of time has elapsed, or if enough tampering is detected.”

“Is that an open threat, Cadet Emma Booker?” Mal’tory spoke carefully, slowly, once more choosing to enunciate every word and dragging each syllable out before ending the question off with a weighty *click*.

“It is a *statement of fact*, Professor Mal’tory.” I shot back plainly. “Because the decisions we make here tonight will determine the outcome of the tragedy that will befall tomorrow. I speak in no uncertain terms when I say this, professor: the threat *is* real, but it is within *your control* to prevent.”

“I find your concern over the safety and well being of others to be misguided, Cadet Emma Booker. You speak and act under the guise of a good samaritan. You coat your aims, decorate your demands, and embellish your words to avoid sounding like a savage who believes violence to be the panacea to all ailments. Yet no matter how well you wrap a dagger in parchment and glamor, its shape remains obvious to those willing to pay your argument even a *second* of thought.” The dark elf continued glaring straight into my lenses, not once shifting, not once displaying even a *crack* in his composure. “You are not the first to offer up violence in negotiations in an attempt to demand results, and you shall most certainly not be the last.”

I had to take a moment to process all of that, as it felt like I’d just been hit with the full force of not just one, or two, but an entire shuttle’s worth of mental gymnasts headed to the denial and misdirection olympics.

“At what point have I demonstrated anything *other* than a complete adherence to the diplomatic process, Professor? From the onset of this whole *situation*, to my attempts to resolve it, I have been nothing but *patient*, nothing but *tolerant*, and nothing but *reasonable*.” My breath hitched up, as I just about caught myself from letting out a frustrated hiss. All pretenses of maintaining *UN bureau-speak* were faltering, as it was clear *that* direction was doing nothing to unstuck the crotchety elf from his high-horse. “The reason why I emphasize the dangers involved is because I cannot stand by idly as a literal ticking time bomb counts down towards a disaster. A disaster which will hurt *your people*, Professor. And as much as we’ve had our disagreements, as much as we might not see eye to eye, I would rather not see anyone *hurt*.” I laid everything out to bare, as I once more threw the ball to Mal’tory’s court. Or what I was beginning to feel was less of a court and more of a solid brick wall.

Yet what I got back in response… wasn’t anything what I expected.

“Apprentice Larial was correct in her observations. You *do* sound strange, Emma Booker.” The man spoke suddenly, taking almost by complete surprise.

“I’m sorry?”

“Whilst an admittedly small sample size, I’ve now heard you at your best attempts at professionalism, and at your most emphatic of emotional responses. You speak with words that are *ours*, yet your tongue is marred by the language of another. Your choice of words is that of a seasoned orator, yet the context they convey is akin to that of a *common* town cryer. I applaud the efforts you have taken to study High Nexian in preparation for your peoples’ candidacy, yet I cannot help but to be offended by the message you force them to convey. It is as if I am being served a dish made from the finest of Nexian ingredients, yet cooked in a manner entirely foreign and unfamiliar. I must wonder, do the concepts of a *higher* and a *lower* tongue not exist in your realm? Are you purposefully speaking to me in the context of that lower tongue to which your heritage belongs?”

“I’m bilingual.” I responded a-matter-of-factly. “The language I use most often, English, doesn’t have such a distinction. But the other language I speak, Thai, does. Though I'm not well versed in it.”

“Ah, multiple local tongues. Tell me, Cadet Emma Booker, considering the varying range of tongues, from which Kingdom within your realm do you hail from? Your strongest? Your wisest? Your most cunning?”

“I’m here on behalf of the *United Nations*, not any one state or territory within its jurisdiction, Professor.”

Mal’tory paused at that, one of his brows raising ever so slightly as he began drumming his fingers against the wooden desk. “A collection of states under a single monarch?” His voice perked up with genuine interest.

“No. A single, cohesive union, under an elected head of government and an appointed head of state.” I clarified without a hint of hesitation.

“Elected… As in an electorate of nobles and landowners?” Mal’tory shot back questioningly.

“No, a constituency consisting of *all* citizens.” I corrected just as quickly.

“A head of state appointed by the Church or Crown?”

“An appointment made by the Civil Advisory.”

“Is that an extension of the state religion or an arm of the crown?”

“It’s an organization made up of leading civil servants and prominent academics.”

“And your *civil servants* alongside your scholars are involved in the appointment of a Head of *State*?”

“Yes.” I replied bluntly.

“And pray tell who is the monarch in charge of this mad house, hmm? What King or Queen, Emperor or Empress, Lord or Lady, has allowed this… *experimental* state of affairs to come to pass under their purview?”

It took a few moments for me to consider the man’s questions, as I cocked my head to the side in confusion. “I… I’m afraid I don’t follow.”

“Your elections held by the masses, your appointments conducted by your state’s servants and scholars, pray tell… what Monarch and what Body of Nobility would allow for their powers to be gambled on a whim? To be dictated by the *common* masses?”

Those series of questions were enough for me to give me pause, as my understanding of Mal’tory’s worldview suddenly *clicked*. He was assuming that the elections for the First Speaker, and the appointments for the First Secretary, were pulling from a candidate pool of *nobles*.

“The First Speaker, and the First Secretary respectively, are positions that can be held by *anyone*, Professor. In fact, there hasn’t been a recorded instance in history where either offices have been filled by a noble. The UN as a nation doesn’t *have* nobility. Some of our states do, like some of the old states within the European Federation, but even in those instances their roles are entirely ceremonial.”

It was at that point that something began happening behind the dark elf’s eyes. His haughtier, unbothered look of disinterest that had already evolved into a mild look of curiosity, had now transcended into a face full of shock and disdain. Moreover, the man refused to respond. It was clear that *something* was going through his head. Something that he didn’t want to say out loud, as he finally gestured for me to take a seat at one of the chairs in front of his desk.

As soon as I did so, he did the same, his piercing look of shock having since returned to the same forced look of disinterest.

Though it was clearer to me now than ever, that this was just a facade. A thick facade, sure, but a facade all the same.

“This makes a great deal of sense.” The dark elf managed out with just the barest hint of facetiousness. “It is no wonder you keep mentioning your concern for the well being of parties uninvolved with our talk. It is also no wonder you cast such a wide and ambiguous net when entertaining this whole discourse, and why you started this conversation with the mention of *compromise* despite our discussions clearly being a zero sum game. You owe your eccentricities to the environment fostered by your home realm. For such a maddening state of affairs to function, there can be *no* decisions made. Only compromises upon compromises, the blind following the blind. The light of enlightenment, smothered by a billion voices.” The man paused, taking a moment to let out a sigh as he locked both his hands in front of him. “So then, Cadet Emma Booker. How do you suggest we proceed?” He suddenly, and unexpectedly, threw the ball back into my court. “Let us see what a child of a realm of anarchy has to say.”

My whole body tensed at that, as I went to immediately correct what could easily be a dangerous political precedent to set. “I need to state for the record that my realm is *not* in a state of anarchy. It never has, and never will be. We’ve fought hard to maintain our democratic traditions and our institutions which protect the rights of all humans: past, present, and future. Generations have sacrificed life and limb to build the future which I now call the present. As a *candidate* sent by my people, it’s my responsibility to make that very clear, Professor. I would refrain from using precedent-setting words such as *anarchy*, for my presence here is the result of the collective efforts of an entire *government*, legitimate and recognized by the entirety of my species. A government of the people, legitimized *by* the people, *for* the people.” I paused, taking a few minutes to gauge the man’s reactions before moving on. “Now, with that being said, I believe it’s time we address the actual issue at hand. My missing luggage, the crate which I am certain Apprentice Larial has already informed you of.”

Mal’tory’s expressions shifted somewhat as I attempted to shift the conversation *back* to the point of this whole encounter. “But this isn’t about the crate, is it, Cadet Emma Booker?” I could swear I could *hear* him grinning despite his facial expressions remaining completely still.

“What?”

“Your claims, your antics, all of it is indicative of a desire to disrupt the status quo for your own aims. This entire *situation* was in effect precipitated by a choice willingly made by your own people.”

“You cannot be serious-”

“Why else would you have violated Stately Decorum by defiling the Minor Shard of Impart?” Mal’tory interjected with a coldness dripping in self-assured certainty.

I could only let out a single, frustrated, exasperated sigh, as the frustrations at the wishy washy nature of the Nexus’ antics finally came to a head in the form of that one simple question.

“You guys said it was a ***gift***!” I finally let it out.

But that was just the beginning.

To say I had *words* to finally say on behalf of the entirety of the IAS, would’ve been a massive understatement.

“Never *once* has the Nexus informed us of Stately Decorum, Professor. Nor any *other* decorum for that matter. You’ve never given us a list of your expectations, a cultural exchange package which we could’ve used to help ease diplomatic exchanges, or *anything* else like that. You didn’t even give us the means by which we ultimately punched a hole through *dimensions*. You gave us vague instructions, you gave us vague pointers, you gave us nothing but what can’t even be considered *crumbs* leading to your world. Yet we pulled through. Using every ounce of determination and grit, and every crazy idea thrown to the wall by the most eccentric of scientists, *we* pulled through. You gave us nothing, and yet I stand here, Professor. If any Decorum was violated in the process then I apologize.” I paused, before shifting my gaze despite the man being unable to see it. “But I, and by extension humanity, cannot be held accountable for the violation of rules which we had no context to or knowledge of in the first place.”

The Professor paused at this for a moment, as if to ponder on my answer, his eyes taking a few moments to consider the orb in front of us; an orb which now looked of absolutely nothing and displayed nothing.

“Then consider your candidacy’s first test, an abject failure, Cadet Emma Booker.” The man spoke with an inkling of haughtiness, wrapped in dismissiveness, still bathed in the same dulcet neutrality he kept up.

“What?”

“The lack of any *context* as you call it, was intentional. It was a means of gauging an as-of-yet unknown civilization’s true nature. We believe the moment a civilization demonstrates their abilities to breach the void between realms to be a pivotal moment in the development of civilization. It is this moment that His Eternal Majesty deems a civilization to be worthy of acknowledgement, where diplomatic relations may be considered. The Nexus is nothing if not *wise*, Emma Booker, and we are nothing if not *fair* in our approach. We gave you these prompts, provided you with these gifts, in order to see how you would react to them. We wanted to see whether or not a reciprocation of decorum was a part of your nature. We wanted to see if you were *cultured* enough to understand the principles of expectant decorum. We wanted to see if it was in your nature to be civilized, and if your culture held civilized values as self-evident through your actions.” The man paused, before manifesting what looked to be *the crate*, along with its immediate surroundings, within the crystal ball in front of us. “However, you’ve shown us that you are incapable of even doing *that*.” With another wave, the image within the crystal ball disappeared. “In the same way you determine if a newly-sapient beast is capable of empathy by giving them a doll of a crying child to see what they do with it, we *gift* newrealms with artifacts with the hopes of seeing what these civilizations eventually do with them. Now tell me, Emma Booker. If you saw a newly-sapient beast tearing a doll of a crying child limb from limb, would you see them as anything *but* failures?”

“That’s a logical fallacy, Professor.”  I stated outright. “You can’t start throwing false equivalencies and claim-”

“I asked you a question, Emma Booker. As your Professor, I demand an answer.” The man interrupted me in a rare display of *some* emotion, even if it was a dose of passion wrapped in dismissiveness.

“I refuse to participate in a bad faith discussion.” I stated plainly, standing my ground as the glint in the man’s eyes shifted.

“Yet another demonstration of Earthrealm’s failure in civil discussion.” The man muttered out under his breath. “Allow me to elaborate, Emma Booker.” The man attempted to bridge the conversation forward, despite my insistence against it. “These artifacts, these most esteemed of gifts, these instructions… they are all a way of gauging both a civilization’s *capabilities* as well as their *societal development*. A *great* civilization has a balance of both. A *good* civilization has only the latter. A *worthless* civilization has neither. Whilst a *delinquent* civilization, has the former without the latter. For the problem with the development of a civilization’s capabilities without proper societal development, is that you end up with *savages with wands*.” The man paused for emphasis, his eyes landing on my pistol *knowingly*. “You end up with a civilization that has progressed its capacity to *do* without its capacity to *think*. You end up with a civilization in capability alone, with little regard for its actions. Earthrealm, by virtue of recent developments, is quickly falling into this category.”

*Enough was enough*.

“And where does the *Nexus* fall into this grand game of categorization?” I shot back.

“At its zenith, beyond *great, good*, and most *certainly* beyond *worthless and delinquents*. For we have achieved an example all adjacent realms strive towards: *utopia*.”

I let that statement hang in the air for a good bit, before finally responding in kind.

“Professor, with all due respect, that is the most *reductive, arrogant, one-sided, uninformed, prejudiced, ignorant,* and downright **asinine** thing I’ve ever heard.” I began, deciding to *not* hold back on the punches. “You talk of big game, position yourself as the *greatest that ever was or will be*, but what happens when someone becomes *greater*?”

“Emma Booker, you are out of line-”

“Your system *relies* on one single conceit: that you maintain overwhelming primacy above all others *no matter what*. *That’s* the reason you took my crate.” I paused, staring daggers into the man’s eyes. “You’re afraid, Professor Mal’tory. You’re afraid of what *could* be when evidence shows that there exists a road less taken.”

“Is this the part where we see the newrealmer claim *utopian* status?” Mal’tory shot back with a dismissive slight.

“No. Because we don’t claim to be perfect. We don’t claim to be a utopia. And you will *never* hear any of our representatives or leaders claim as such, all because of one, *very* simple reason: we are creatures of progress, and *not* stagnation. To claim that there is a fixed end to civilization, like some sort of a happily-ever-after in a children’s book, is to invite the demons of stagnation to start gnawing away at a culture until all there is left is complacency; history has proven that *nothing* good ever comes out of complacency. The only way we’ve achieved what we have, is by dispelling that culture of complacency by recognizing that utopia as an end-goal doesn’t *have* to exist. Rather, the best state for civilization to be in, is a constant state of self-improvement. *That’s* what we stand for, and that’s what our civilization is built around.”

I heard words echoed throughout the room, as Mal’tory’s facade began chipping away bit by bit, before finally… he snapped. In that his neutral look of disinterest contorted into a dismissive frown. “I’ve heard similar words spoken before.” He announced, before standing up from his desk and back towards the window. “I know how this ends.”

I tried standing up, but not before I felt the wood of the chair *growing* around my limbs. “In time, perhaps not in your lifetime, your people will understand.”

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 590% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

“I’m afraid this will be it, Emma Booker. I will see to it that your *luggage* situation is tended to. Fear not, for it will no longer be an issue *either* of us will have to worry about for much longer.”

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 775% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

It was at that point that I saw the window *melting* into what I could only describe as a portal, an aperture into another room.

The same room that I’d seen the crate sitting in through that crystal ball.

“Worry not, the chair will release you in due course. I wish for you to sit and ruminate on your choice of words and actions thus far, Emma Booker.” The man turned around one final time, before putting one foot through the portal.

…

There comes a point where you’re faced with a decision, a situation where you have neither the time to think or ponder the consequences, but only on whether or not you decide to take the plunge.

In that moment, in those scant few seconds, you have a rare chance to see who you really are. Whatever obligations, social or otherwise you might have, are unable to register in the time it takes for you to decide…

Do.

Or don’t.

And it was clear by my gut instinct to *move* before I could even *consider* my actions, that I was the type to *do*.

*CRACK*

*SNAP*

I felt those flimsy restraints *snapping* like the twigs they were, and the chair all but crumbling, as the full force of the suit’s exoskeleton shifting into high gear caused its legs to *snap*.

Whatever the consequences were, whatever happened next, would all result from *my* decision. I felt myself leaping from that chair, *just* grazing the back of the dark elf’s cloak, before I *fell* into absolute *nothingness*.

My question didn’t linger in the air for long.

In fact, it was almost immediately reciprocated, but not by the owl, Buddy, nor any other voice. Instead, it was reciprocated by a long, dull droning sound; one that shook the entire building to its core. A sound that was as otherworldly as the noise generated by a warp drive revving up to full power.

This was soon followed by thousands of distinct large *thumps*, as heavy, leather bound books smacked across an untold number of desks, tables, and plush leather armchairs not too dissimilar to the ones found in Mal’tory’s office.

Except instead of the dark, brooding, and foreboding atmosphere of that Victorian-themed nightmare, there was a certain *magical* nature to the whole scene. The presence of a thousand or so foxes flipping through untold pages at blistering speeds definitely helped to offset the otherwise bizarre and ominous nature of it all.

“Radio.” The owl parroted back, in exactly the same tone and enunciation I’d used.

**“Radio.”** The room of foxes responded back in unison, their page-flipping continuing for a solid few minutes before it all inexplicably came to a stop as suddenly as it began.

With a resounding *thump* of tens of thousands of books closing all at once.

The veritable army of foxes would come to meet the owl’s questioning gaze, each and every one resolving to a pout and a shake of their heads as soon as their eyes met the owl’s.

The whole library began producing another long, dull droning. As the foxes that had appeared with books in tow, all ran off back into unseen and unknown corners and crevices, completely disappearing from even the EVI’s sensor feeds.

It was now just Buddy and the owl resting atop his head that remained. The owl in particular quickly took charge once more. “Radio.” He repeated. “Subject matter classification-”

“-Communication.” I quickly interjected, taking literally no one except for Buddy completely off guard, the armored fox cocking his head from side to side; his face locked in a perpetual expression of confusion and curiosity.

“That’s what this whole trade boils down to, doesn’t it?” I asked rhetorically, garnering a tentative nod from the owl in response. “An artificial means of augmenting communication, all in an attempt to address a problem that plagues *all* civilizations. A problem that becomes all but a guaranteed issue for any would-be organized group wishing to maintain any hope of cohesion beyond the sightlines of a town or village. Because the moment when you set your sights on organizing, controlling, and maintaining people and lands beyond the sightlines of your hall, keep, or castle, is the moment when you realize that we’re all fundamentally limited by the same thing… our ability to get information from one place to another. For the greater the extent of your claims, and the further you expand your reach, the more difficult this task becomes. So for an empire as expansive and as grand as the Nexus-” I spoke in a half-condescending, somewhat sarcastic tone, realizing well that doing so wouldn’t incur any faux pas’ with the library. “-this becomes a pertinent issue.” I paused, taking a moment to regard all eyes in the room before continuing. “I know this… *we* know this… because we’ve experienced the same growing pains back home.”

There were no gasps of surprise this time around, as the captive audience of foxes and the lone owl seemed captivated rather than shocked.

In fact, even Thacea’s expression remained similar enough to the owl in composure. Though I knew that was more than likely the result of her stoic poker face, and was most definitely not representative of what was probably brewing underneath the surface.

“I’m sure we had some parallels in this regard, I’m sure the Nexus wasn’t always capable of long distance communication using crystals. I’m sure *someone* had to have had the brilliant idea of running the distance between two towns. And I’m sure this eventually evolved into relying on the endurance of a horse, the speed of a pigeon, and the skill of a courier as time progressed. However, there *had* to have been a breaking point. A point where your ambitions grow beyond the limitations of these crude, analog, and primitive means of addressing the physical information gap. A point where these systems become fundamentally inadequate if you wish, hope, and *desire* for more. So whilst the Nexus dabbled in solutions to this issue utilizing magic, with their crystals and teleportation spells, we instead branched off into a completely different path; a road less taken.”

“A road not defined or limited by the skills of a mage, but created, maintained, and refined by the sacrifices of generations of scholars and researchers.”

“Because we didn’t have the abundance of mana to work with, nor were we born with the innate *gift* of mana-manipulation. Heck, our world doesn’t even *have* any mana to begin with. We were, and still are, a mana-less people, with no less of a desire to expand, progress, and push forward our reach as the Nexus clearly did. Our ambitions could not be tempered by the *supposed* reality of our situation. Our sights were always set upon the next hill. Our hearts were always drawn to the next horizon. Our destiny was always to cross the distance of oceans. Regardless of if they were oceans of water or oceans of stars. It’s not in our nature to sit idly by, and we definitely were not willing to accept the limitations imposed upon us by the natural world. So we pushed forward. Each generation dedicating their lives to the observation and study of reality, and each generation making gradual, consistent improvements by harnessing *everything* from the world around us, using our understanding of its rules to construct a reality we *wanted* to see, all in service of our own aims.”

I took a deep breath at the end of my preamble, just in time for the building around us to once again drone and creak loudly, giving the owl pause as he addressed me just as the noises settled.

“So in a similar vein to how magic and the magical arts were constructed to observe, understand, and to eventually manipulate the fundamental forces of the universe, so too did Earthrealm do this with *another* set of fundamental cosmic paradigms?” The owl shot back questioningly, his eyes burrowing through my opaque lenses not with predisposed doubt and scrutiny, but with a fiery curiosity barely contained behind those spheres of amber.

“Correct.”

“And you do not call this magic?”

“No, in fact,  that term is exclusively used for impossible flights of fantasy; reserved for the realm of fiction and the imagination. Only now are we seeing that it is, in fact, a very real reality. A reality that we were not able to actualize, for reasons that are now very clear to us.”

“So if not magic, then what? What is the name of your systematic study of the fundamental forces?”

“We call this discipline: *science*.” I began, accentuating that last word in particular. “And we call the practical application of the principles derived from its scholarly endeavors: *technology*.”

A long drone punctuated that answer, the owl purposefully pausing as if to seemingly listen to it.

“And this is how you discovered and harnessed the *radio*.” The owl tentatively responded. “It is another one of your systems of *technology*, derived from these roundabout *observations* founded in your *science*.” He concluded.

To which I could only nod in reply. “Correct. So in a similar manner to how the Nexus has uncovered the secrets of magic utilizing their innate gifts, so too have we uncovered the fundamental principles which govern our own reality, using tools and ingenuity to bridge the gap where our physiologies could no longer take us. We discovered that reality can be broken down further than the observable world, and that anything and everything is composed of constituents imperceptible to the senses. Senses which evolved only to be *good enough*, imbuing us with as much fidelity that was needed to facilitate our physical survival and nothing more. Yet we, as sapient beings, could never be satiated with just *good enough*. We discovered proof of a reality beneath the one we see, the building blocks of the world we touch, feel, and interact with on a daily basis. We discovered the microcosmos, the constituents of the world on a scale so small that a single grain of sand’s basic components can be counted in the quintillions.”

I took a moment to breathe, before slowly and methodically, I began shaking my head.

""But that wasn’t good enough for us. That just wasn’t *enough*.” I continued, my voice carrying with it the bottled up passion and excitement of five thousand years of unrepentant progress. “We were hungry, ravenous, and above all else furiously *curious* for more. So we kept digging down, deeper and deeper, smaller and smaller still, because we *knew* above all else that if the microcosmos was real, then it had to end *somewhere*.”

“And eventually, after centuries of searching, we finally found it. Within the science we dub physics, we discovered what we call the *fundamental forces*. The basic fundamentals that could not be broken down into further constituents except by virtue of mathematical extrapolation. This handful of fundamentals, which I shall be sparse on for now, act as laws determining how the fundamental building blocks of reality itself interact and decay. And it was within one of these fundamentals, what we refer to as *electromagnetism*, that we unlocked the ultimate potential of communication… the radio.”

I paused once more, as I rummaged through one of my pouches in preparation of what was to come. “For within electromagnetism, we learned that there existed invisible and imperceptible… waves of energy. Waves of energy derived from and emitted as a result of *other* properties of the fundamental physical building blocks of the microcosmos. Suffice it to say, we harnessed these invisible waves of energy. We learned to imbue them with information using tools and machines capable of sending and receiving these waves of energy. These… *radio waves* as we call them.”

“I can appreciate a straightforward system of etymology.” The owl finally responded, adding his two cents after intensely scrutinizing every word that had come out of my mouth thus far.

“Yeah, our scientists tend to be a lot more… on the nose when it comes to naming conventions.”

“With all of this being said, Cadet Emma Booker, I do require *proof* of this concept. Do you have anything which we may observe which could serve as evidence to these claims?”

I grinned excitedly, before pulling out the same earpiece I’d given to Thalmin earlier. “I thought you’d never ask.”

I outstretched my hand towards both Buddy and the Librarian, revealing an unassuming device that the pair looked at with varying levels of scrutiny. Buddy in particular was practically *shaking* with excitement, though it was clear the owl was holding him back from going all in.

“This is the most straightforward example I can come up with on short notice.” I began. “It’s a two-way variable-range transceiver. Now, I want you to try…” I paused, before using one of my other hands to vaguely gesture at the air around it. “... sensing for its mana-streams, or lack thereof. As far as I know, *everything* magical in the Nexus requires mana to function right?” I recalled my back and forths with Sorecar, and all of the artifices and magical implements the Nexus was capable of producing en masse.

“Correct, Cadet Emma Booker.”

“It’s logical then to assume that a communications device such as the minor shard of impart or anything within the status communicatia would likewise require mana to function. Either in the form of a-”

I paused, turning to the EVI for support.

*“EVI, what were the mana battery things Sorecar mentioned?”*

**“Mana Ducts for the siphoning of ambient mana, Mana Ampoules as a portable mana-battery analogue, and enchanted cores.”**

*“Thanks.”* I spoke internally, before continuing on seamlessly with the owl.

“-mana duct, mana ampoule, or some form of enchantment, correct?”

“Correct.” The owl nodded in response.

“So with all that being said, I’d like Buddy to take a good sniff of this, see if there’s any mana trickery or magical shenanigans going on. I want to prove that this tool of communication, this *Radio*, can work *without* mana.” I offered, causing Buddy to crane his eyes up towards the Librarian expectantly, just *waiting* for the go-ahead.

A nod of approval from the Librarian was all that was needed for Buddy to absolutely go nuts, as all that pent-up energy went towards his more than eager attempts at data-collection.

Though to be fair, data-collection was probably the last word I’d use to describe the fox’s antics, because in truth all this really amounted to was copious amounts of sniffing, and the occasional gentle booping.

Given the reality of the situation... I think I'd rather stick with *data-collection* when describing the scene in my report.

*The auditors could watch the vid-logs for themselves if they wanted to dispute that.*

“NO MANA FOUND! SO MANY UNKNOWN MATERIALS! METAL AND NOT-METAL! CERAMIC AND NOT-CERAMIC! AND A SQUISHY!” Buddy exclaimed, panting excitedly as his forepaws buzzed in a little dance that caused the owl to clack his talons *hard* against his helmeted head, bringing him down from that overexcitable high.

“You’ve proven your point, Cadet Emma Booker. The artifice in your palm is indeed *not* imbued with mana, but is in fact, constructed of a great number of other *unknown* materials.” The Librarian nodded approvingly. “So how do you wish to use this artifice to provide proof to your claims?” He just as quickly threw the ball back to my court.

“By simply demonstrating that it works without mana.” I answered with a shrug. “And if Buddy’s willing, by using him as the other end of the receiving signal.”

No sooner did I say that did Buddy react *immediately*, vibrating in place, causing his platemail armor to once again generate that distinctive *rattling* noise.

“I’m going to take that as a yes?” I shot back, not so much towards Buddy, but towards the owl who nodded once in reply. Taking that as a yes, I continued. “Right, so, the earpiece has an effective range of about… four miles, five if we’re pushing it. Though I’d prefer if we found a space where there’s no obstacles in the way in order to maximize the-”

That low dulcet rumbling returned, as the whole room once again began *shaking* to its core. This time, the very atrium we were standing in suddenly expanded, stretching impossibly long to the point where I actually felt nauseous and disoriented by the sudden shift in perspective. I felt like I was in one of those weird reality-bending VR sims, or one of those MC Escher paintings where the geometry and architecture of a room was just *wrong*. Before me laid an atrium that was now stretched about five miles in a single direction, with a mysterious shadowy fog artificially obstructing the render distance in any direction but forward.

“Will this distance be sufficient?” The owl asked, pulling me right out of my brain fog.

“Erm, yeah, that’ll do.” I managed out, before kneeling down to Buddy’s height. “So here’s my plan, I’ll affix the device to Buddy’s ear, and he’ll go down five miles in that direction.” I pointed down the impossibly long hall. “Then, I’ll speak into my own internal radio.” I pointed at my helmet’s mouthpiece. “And if everything works well, then you’ll have your proof.”

The owl nodded once, before taking off, pulling with him Buddy’s helmet, giving me full access to his furred head.

The excitable fox was *barely* capable of holding still as I began the awkward process of putting the device onto an anatomy it wasn’t meant for. However, with a bit of effort, and a lot of finagling with the excess silicone straps, it finally fit snugly in place.

Taking a step back, I couldn’t help but to smile as the little thing looked like he’d just walked straight out of a Space Vulpine game. All he needed now was a single eyepiece to complete the look.

“Alright. Ready?” I asked, to which Buddy nodded eagerly, before turning to the owl for final approval.

With a nod from the librarian, the little thing *zipped* to my right, going behind a bunch of bookshelves, before suddenly, and without warning, appearing right down the newly elongated hall.

“Did he just teleport-”

“That is outside the scope of this discussion, Cadet Emma Booker. Now, please proceed with the demonstration.” The owl spoke with more than a hint of eagerness.

“Alright.” I let out a breath. “Here goes nothing.”

I blinked towards my right, the gesture being enough to activate a secure channel. A stylized image of an earpiece popped onto my HUD completely green and with full bars.

“Hello Buddy, can you hear me?” I spoke, as to my horror and dread I realized I suddenly blew it again. The first words through a radio in the Nexus… or more accurately, in the library… would now forever be recorded as *Hello Buddy*…

Buddy, however, almost immediately defused that train of thought with a series of excitable cackles that came in loud and clear over the airwaves.

“I CAN HEAR! I CAN HEAR IN MY RIGHT EAR! THE VOICE IS COMING FROM THE ARTIFICE ITSELF! LIBRARIAN! LIBRARIAN! EMMA WAS RIGHT! THIS IS A COMPLETELY NOVEL FORM OF MANA-LESS COMMUNICATION! AHAHAHAHA!” The rest of Buddy’s rambles were a collection of indistinguishable noises that ranged between outright *cackles* and pure unadulterated wheezes of excitement.

“So it would seem.” The Librarian spoke with a surprising degree of composure, though his eyes betrayed a look of a 20th century entrepreneur having discovered yet another marketable discovery. “Now, I must clarify a few things, Cadet Emma Booker. For the purposes of Category, and not so much Weight.”

“Alright. I’m all ears.”

“Is this… communication, limited to a realm? I ask for the sake of categorical consistency. For you ask for information on the minor shards of impart and the status communicatia, both of which are inter-realm communication methods. As I see it, this *radio*, whilst impressive, may be lacking in that regards.”

I couldn’t help but to grin underneath my helmet, for the final play I had stored for this eventuality. “What do you define as a realm?”

“For the purposes of this exchange, it is a plane of existence bounded by earth and sky.”

“Then, no.” I grinned. “Radio waves travel way *beyond* the confines of earth and sky.”

The owl, for the first time, visibly shifted at this. *Something* was happening behind its eyes. As its head began *tilting* ninety degrees from side to side.

“Purposely, or as a result of its natural characteristics?” The owl questioned sharply.

“Both. But nowadays, we *intentionally* beam these waves of energy back and forth, not just within the confines of our sky, but to bodies beyond its reach.”

“To bodies *beyond* the sky that binds you?” The owl looked at me once more, eyeing my arms, then Thacea’s wings.

“Yes.”

“For what purpose?”

Here was my chance.

“To communicate beyond the confines of what the Nexus might consider a *single* realm. To communicate with bodies likewise bound by earth and sky, or no sky at all. To communicate with others like me that inhabit the heavens and beyond. In short: to communicate to those beyond my realm. And isn’t that what Status Communicatia is all about?”

Buddy at this point had all but stopped moving. His body went rigid, as it looked as if he was about to fall flat on his side. It was only due to the aid of several more foxes that he remained upright, and was promptly carried over to the ever growing congregation of foxes that encircled me.

“And your people, *inhabiting the heavens*, clarify: how, why, and for what purpose?”

“I’m afraid that is beyond the scope of this exchange.” I answered promptly and without a twinge of hesitation.

The owl, instead of seeming offended, hurt, or in any way indignant from that response, merely stared at me with respect, before nodding once. “That it is.” It spoke, not pressing the matter further.

“But with all that being said…” The owl continued, edging towards a new point. “There is *one* discrepancy that delineates this novel method of communication from the Status Communicatia.”

“And that is?”

“Your methodology, relying on this fundamental force of nature. It is still bound by the limitations of physical distance is it not?”

My heart skipped a beat at that, taken aback by the owl’s comprehension and dissection of the concept he’d *just* learned. “Any physical force of nature is bound to the limitations of its laws. I observed that there existed a *noticeable* delay between the moment you spoke and the moment your assistant received those words. A slight delay, but still one that has grave implications. For it establishes the precedent that these waves of energy, these *radiowaves*, travel at a certain speed, and thus are beholden to the limitations imposed by the infinite nature of physical space. This is in contrast to the Minor Shards of Impart which relies on a methodology that does not necessitate the crossing of physical space, thus making the two methods of communication fundamentally incompatible. So as novel as your explanation is, I am afraid that the information I can provide will be limited to methods *analogous* to your own, of which there are many, including *Tethers, Flares,* and *Puddlejumping* for instance.”

“So you want an equivalent of a means of communication that manages to skirt past the fundamental limitations of physical space as a limiting factor?”

“Correct.” The owl clarified, leading to a silence that even he seemed to believe could not be filled.

“We have that too.”

The room audibly *buckled* at that, as more beady eyes emerged from the shadows, each and every one transfixed on my vocoder.

The whole world seemed to stop, as even the owl’s beak remained slightly ajar, his feathers even puffing up a bit before receding.

“Explain.” The owl urged.

“In our race to expand across the heavens, we came across the issue which you speak of. The fundamental limitations of relying on a methodology inherently bound to the rules of the physical space it must physically bridge. This was unacceptable to our government, especially given our governing laws on the welfare of the state and its citizenry. A state must be capable of reacting, responding, and reliably administering its reach within its own borders without fail. Traditional communication using radio waves would be insufficient to these ends. We learned that lesson across our tentative first few steps across the stars. Thus, we created another method. A way of *skirting around* this physical limitation. We came across what we refer to as quantum entanglement, and using that principle, created what is now known as the *QE Network*. A method of communication that completely circumvents the limitations of space, binding two particles in two points in space together by an unseen tether, whereby the movement of one elicits the movement of another. These small shifts can be manipulated. And thus, like radio, can be used to transmit concepts using encoding and deciphering. All of this, without needing to physically bridge the gap. All of this being *instantaneous*.” I paused, taking a huge breath after that spiel, turning to the owl expectantly. “Will *this* be sufficient?”

The whole room, whilst already quiet, seemed to grow even quieter as I finished my brief explanation of a concept that would require the EVI to step in to properly explain. Yet despite my surface level understanding and explanation, something within the owl’s eyes seemed to *click*, as it ‘smiled’ in a way only a bird could manage. “Yes. Sufficient enough for your query, at the very least.” The owl spoke with a certain satisfaction in its voice. “And your proof?”

I paused at that, letting out a large sigh in response as I simply shrugged. “Unfortunately, QE systems aren’t as portable nor as readily available as radio. As such, I don’t have one on hand.”

But just as soon as those words left my mouth, did another idea slam against me with the force of a truck.

“EVI.”

**“Yes, Cadet Booker.”**

“Pull up a *partial* proof of QE. Nothing that can be turned into something legitimately useful, nothing that could be used for practical application. Just… proof of it. And maybe not even the *whole* proof.”

**“Purposefully block out vital aspects of the theorem?”**

“Correct.”

**“Affirmative. Uploading results to DATAPAD01.**”

I immediately unlatched the datapad from my belt, before turning it towards the owl expectantly and with a smirk underneath my helmet. “But I do have this.” I quickly corrected my course with the owl.

It was clear the librarian didn’t need any prompting to begin *devouring* the contents on the screen with his eyes. As he began darting from up and down the light-mode enabled device, prompting his pupils to squint somewhat as he adjusted to the light.

It took about half a minute, but after a solid few moments of deliberation, the owl eventually turned his attention back squarely on me.

“Earthrealm… and your *kind*, are utterly *fascinating* Cadet Emma Booker.” The owl responded with a certain *glee* in his voice, as a table was immediately pulled up in front of us. At around the same time, several books began flying from the shelves, landing right in front of Thacea, as if the owl understood what our dynamic was from our first visit here in the library. “Even after all that has transpired, and the trauma that has been incurred upon it, the library wishes to express nothing but adamant appreciation and wishes to reciprocate fairly and accordingly.”

Thacea, to her credit, took only a few moments to readjust to the situation. Despite her frazzled appearance, her thousand-yard stare, and her ruffled feathers, she took to the mission like a trooper. Her hands began flipping through the available pages, but reeled back as a few suddenly were drained of ink just as her hands grazed them.

“To clarify, Cadet Emma Booker. Would you wish to exchange the information of the *radio* for a Nexian equivalent now, or would you like to incur a deficit from the library, garnering credit on your card for this information later? I wish to ask as your inquiry was focused solely on the Status Communcatia and the Shards of Impart, and *not* the *Tethers, Flares,* and so on and so forth.”

I raised my brow at that, seeing that several books around Thaceea had gone blank, save for what was presumably the one on the crystal I requested earlier. “So, I’m assuming that right now the only book that’s readable is the one on the Minor Shard of Impart and the Status Communicatia?” I attempted to clarify.

“Correct, Cadet Emma Booker.”

I took a deep breath, looking at *all* of the information laid out in front of me, and the potential to learn it all *now*.

“Emma.” Thacea interjected, her voice barely a squeak compared to the vocal range used between me and the owl thus far. I turned to her, as she gave me a look that I immediately understood. “These other topics are known to me, and thus we may discuss this *later*.”

*And that’s why you always bring an expert to haggle with the locals.*

“I’ll hold off on that for now, thanks.” I shot back with a smile towards the owl, but not before giving Thacea an appreciative nod.

“Very well.” The owl nodded, as several books were pulled back for now, leaving just what we were after.

Thacea didn’t need much prompting as she began diving *deep* into the books in front of her, starting with one that was open to a page that displayed a prominent diagram of what I immediately recognized as a shard of impart.

The Avinor went to town on reading it immediately, her eyes darting across the page, as I noticed that the fox crowd had slowly begun pulling back into the shadows from whence they came.

All, save for one near-catatonic fox, who immediately booted back to life as soon as I touched him. Without much prompting, Buddy leaped up into my arms, draping across my shoulders, as I made my way towards an armchair immediately next to Thacea.

Letting out a long, tired sigh, I took a moment to shut my brain off, enjoying the silence of the library, occasionally interrupted by the flipping of pages and the squirming of a fox who had now made my lap his home.

Twenty minutes passed, as Thacea’s gaze remained transfixed on that first book, flipping back and forth between several pages as if to cross reference what she’d just read.

“Emma.” She finally spoke, her eyes staring right at me as she pointed at a diagram of a crystal, before flipping the page to reveal an image of a familiar crystalline dragon.

(Author’s Note: And here we go! The first real back and forth between Emma and the Library! Two titans of knowledge going back and forth! I really hope it turned out alright haha, as I wanted to balance the elements of the exchange as well as the flow and pacing of it all. Also, you may have noticed that a certain bird princess has been silent throughout all of this! I can tell you right now that our Avinor princess has a lot of thoughts on the whole exchange, and we’ll certainly see her take on the revelations of Earthrealm from her POV in the next chapter! :D **The next Chapter is already up on Patreon if you guys are interested in getting early access to future chapters!**)

**Dragon’s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30, Living Room. Local Time: 1430 Hours.** 

**Emma**

“Conspicuous.” Thacea remarked.

“Suspicious, is how I’d describe it.” Thalmin commented.

“Earthrealmer… do your people know *nothing* of aesthetic theory?” Ilunor added with *flair*, raising a single hand to rest his forehead against as he did so.

All eyes were currently set on the latest addition to the armor. The first in-field modification made with the intent to not only bridge the gap between magic and technology, but likewise, made in an attempt to compensate for what humanity lacked — manasight.

“I admit, it *is* a bit crude, even by our expeditionary standards.” I nodded in a rare instance of acknowledgement towards the Vunerian’s whinings. “However, I’m sorta pressed for R&D capacity right now, so this is the best I can do for a little while.” 

I began fiddling with the calibration tools, going through the roster of prototype overlays cooked fresh by the EVI, as well as the early alpha models pre-packaged by the techies back home. The latter of which were designed with a very different development roadmap in mind. 

There had always been the expectation that the EVI would eventually be able to improve upon the barebones of the M-RSAD systems, with the idea being that the current sensor suite would be incrementally iterated upon based on the wealth of data the Nexus provided; being constantly saturated in mana was a far better testbed than any hypothetical model could offer back on the homefront.

However, the addition of the wand threw a spanner in the works in probably the best way possible. It promised to expand the sensitivity of the M-RSAD’s primarily-passive systems. It had the capacity to augment, if not entirely supplant the M-RSAD’s discrete readings on distinct mana radiation types. And whilst unable to truly ‘augment’ manasight, as it was intended for in manasight impaired mages, it’d be its *accessory* features — the overlooked physical cues — that could be translated into an acceptable analogue. 

The intensity of its glow, its color, and, most importantly, its slight *movements* could easily be interpreted by the EVI. Its enclosure and stem, providing it six degrees of freedom, would grant it an unrivalled spatial awareness that the EVI could exploit to its fullest effect. With every twitch and torque of the wand translated into a flurry of live data, rendering the previously invisible world around me into something I could at last *somewhat* visualize… albeit with some significant drawbacks in the realms of fidelity and ‘frame rate’, as it were.

The potential for mana-field visualization *on top* of what we already had was still a massive leap forward, though. However, this also came with the issue as to exactly what *form* this visualization would take. 

The R&D boys back home *were* limited to what they knew, after all. And while our home-grown overlay prototypes *were* sufficient, every model I had available was still working under the scope of human innovation up to that point.

The operative word here being ‘human.’

The *manasight initiative*, as I was coining it, was a completely alien endeavor. With its own novel set of contexts that needed to be taken into consideration before we even *began* approaching exactly *how* we’d be layering the magical world on top of the physical.

I needed some uniquely alien insight as a result, and it wasn’t like I was short of that around here.

“Right. Here’s where I’m going to need your help, guys.” I began, interrupting the flurry of conversation that flowed amongst the trio whilst I was busy working inside my own little world.

“Help? Hmmph, fancy that. I thought the word was entirely *absent* from your vocabulary.” Ilunor began with a haughty chuckle. “Well then, let us hear it. How may *we*, the esteemed members of highborn society, aid you in your… *requests*, oh *Cadet* Emma Booker?” 

I couldn’t help but to blink at the Vunerian and his exceptionally catty antics this time around.

“Erm, well. I had two requests, actually. The first probably being the most important for the long term prospects of this whole *mana-sight* thing. I’d like you to show me exactly what you guys see. I want to know *how* you guys perceive the world beyond just the ‘corporeal’ one.”

The deluxe kobold’s features grew increasingly more arrogant and sly as I talked, culminating in an inflated grin at the tail end of my request.

“Oh how *tragic*… the earthrealmer *finally* admits her limits. Her *natural* shortcomings, might I add.” He quickly turned to both Thacea and Thalmin, who looked on at him with varying levels of impatience. “What? I am speaking the truth, am I not? For *weeks* now, Emma Booker has been gallivanting with bold and noble posturing, claiming *parity* this and *parity* that! Now, we finally see the **limitations** to this so-called parity! In the form of her self-admitted cries for aid, no less! ” He paused, before turning towards my helmet’s eternally poker-faced expression. “I, of course, mean no offense by this, Cadet Emma Booker. I am merely… *clarifying* matters for the unwritten record.”

“By rubbing it in, no less.” Thalmin growled out.

“‘Tis but an orator’s drive, Prince Thalmin. For a dragon strikes when it tastes weakness in the manastreams.”

“By mocking Emma’s shortcomings?” Thacea chimed in. “Targeting an aspect of her being that she had no control over in choosing?” She questioned tersely.

“Cadet Emma Booker has made it clear that we are in a long, protracted game of *posturing*. Be that political, martial, physical, or even personal.” The Vunerian paused, taking a moment to cross his arms as he did so. “This means there are no standards to be held, and no topic which remains sacred.”

“Where I come from, a low blow is a low blow all the same. Carrying with it dishonor and shame, *Nexian*.” Thalmin seethed. 

“Well then, thankfully, such outdated notions are now matters of *domestic* politics, rather than relevant conventions of *contemporary* conversation.” Ilunor shot back just as snappily, prompting me to finally clear the air with a protracted sigh.

“Alright alright. Let’s all just take a step back.” I began, prompting the pair to turn their heads towards me. “Save your strength for the sparring match, Thalmin. Ilunor’s just not worth the effort.” 

This elicited an indignant glare from the Vunerian, who I quickly addressed next.

“And Ilunor? That’s the whole reason why I’m even asking you for your help. Because while I didn’t *choose* to lack a manafield—” I paused, turning to Thacea with a nod of appreciation as I did so. “—I’m *choosing* to overcome it by doing what my people always do when faced with the impossible.”

I could practically feel the Vunerian’s inner dialogue through the shift in his features, as I could just about see him going ‘*Here we go again.*’ behind those golden eyes. 

“So if you’d be so kind, how about we stop with the defensive posturing, and show me exactly what the world is like through your *noble* and discerning eyes.” I urged as the little mast-mounted sensor dome continued spinning in ‘excitement’ atop the suit’s ‘backpack’.

“And how do you propose we go about doing so, Cadet Emma Booker?” Ilunor shot back. “Manasight is a *gift*, one which no corporeal analogue can match.” 

“I’m not gunning for a one-to-one here.” I countered. “In fact, an analogue is exactly what I’m looking for. And as for *how* we’re going to go about this? Maybe a quick trip to the ZNK-19 will do the trick.” I grinned.

…

**15 Minutes Later**

… 

A quick trip to the ZNK-19 most certainly *did not* do the trick.

But that flop was more broadly attributed to me than anything else.

There was a… *learning curve*, when it came to much of the interfacing. One that caused more grief than was worth the time being put into it.

“Earthrealmer, exactly *how* do I force these silly little lines into pools of magma?” Ilunor yapped out, attempting to jab his fingers into the 3D vector ‘cubes’ that had attempted to match his demands, but had turned into little more than a pile of broken assets at the behest of his finagling.

“*Earthrealmer*, why are your false projections so *stubborn* and unwieldy?” The deluxe kobold reiterated, moving his hands like he was wading through water.

“**Earthrealmer**, why is this infernal space not responding to the whims of my *will*?” He continued, simply resorting to waving his hand haphazardly in the air, as if expecting the hologram to somehow read his mind.

“I showed you the tutorial, Ilunor. You have to *specify* what you want, and it’ll provide you a brush, palette, and everything else you need to—”

“But why do you not make it respond to my whims as it does *yours*, earthrealmer?”

That singular line of complaint gave me pause.

Before suddenly, it all just *clicked*. 

“Because it responds to me *telling* it what I want it to do.” I began. “Sometimes you don’t hear it because I choose to filter out what goes through my helmet, but my machines have always responded to commands, whether that be voice, iris, haptic, or some other indirect interface.” 

That response gave Ilunor pause for thought too, as he perked up a brow and immediately crossed his arms. 

“I had always assumed your sight-seers were responding to some unspoken form of manaless command, some abominable means by which your will was enforced on these…” The Vunerian trailed off, as it was clear *something* was now ticking away deep behind those formerly irreverent eyes. 

“It is through your *radio,* isn’t it?” Thalmin responded in Ilunor’s stead. “The same device you used to communicate with me during your grappling gambit to Larial’s private ward.”

“And the same device with which you impressed the library.” Thacea added, her eyes glowing with thoughtful intent. 

“Well… it’s a bit more involved and complicated than that. Our people have gone *deep* into not only mastering radio, but iterating on the various *forms* of frequencies through which we can both wirelessly communicate, and send commands through. For example… *beach, noon, zero entities with background ambiance*.” I commanded, gesturing at the empty grid-lined void around us. One which quickly transitioned to a beachside resort somewhere on the idyllic coasts of Rayong, the simulated sun bearing down on all of us, whilst the Boldy Digital surround sound systems blared some generic tropical music set against the relaxing sounds of crashing waves. “Suffice it to say, I’m constantly going back and forth between a lot of non-automated systems, and even then, I’m also constantly fine-tuning the general orders of the automated systems whenever the need arises.” 

Ilunor’s eyes began widening something fierce, but instead of him voicing anything just yet, it was Thacea who perked up first.

“This requires a vastly different… *skillset* to the ones most mages are accustomed to.” She began. “Or more accurately, this approach is inherently far more *involved* in avenues that are just so much more…”

 

“Unintuitive.” Ilunor chimed in, his features turning not into one of offense, but genuine intrigue. 

“*Different*, is probably a better way I’d describe it.” I countered immediately, crossing my arms as I did so. “I assume the issue here is in your approach, as Thacea put it. Mages, at least from what I’ve gathered so far, have little in the way of an *interface gap* between thought and action. This applies not just for casting spells, but from what I’ve gathered, also applies to your artifices.” 

The Vunerian nodded, urging me to—

“Just get to the point.”

“Right, well, I was just going to say…  you’re more or less used to things just happening seamlessly. No user interface, no *gap* between tool and user.” I paused once more. “Just pure willpower over your surroundings.”

“Return to Sketchpad Two.” I commanded, causing the world to return to that empty grid vector layout. 

“To circle back to your question, Ilunor, I’m afraid I can’t get it to *bend to your will*. As there’s no hidden manaless shenanigans comparable to your manafield going on.” I gestured around us once more. “All there is here, is a learning curve. One that I admittedly underestimated, so you must forgive me for that oversight.” 

The Vunerian paused at that, something once more stirring within him.

“So… theoretically speaking, *any* human from earthrealm can come to learn to use this projector, your conveyance, and any number of manaless artifices you’ve demonstrated so far?”

“Yeah, exactly. The only barrier to entry is the learning curve involved in the operation of certain tools or machines. But for the most part, these projectors? Multimedia devices such as my tablet? All of those are just intuitive enough to pick up and learn.”

“I see…” Thalmin acknowledged, before turning to a grin. “You’re most certainly not diminishing my claims as to your realm’s nature as a nation of scholars, Emma.” Thalmin chided. 

“Perhaps this is why you often seem so absent-minded, earthrelamer.” Ilunor offered cattily. “If you must consistently divvy up your mental faculties, never focusing on any singular action for long, then I fear for what sort of society this has fostered.” 

A part of me wanted to address that particular subject matter, bringing up the EVI as a point to expand upon.

However, I knew it was better to leave sleeping dogs lie, and to just move on.

This just wasn’t the time for that.

“Perhaps we should focus instead on the task at hand?” Thacea chirped out. 

“Right, yeah, so… it’s clear the ZNK-19 isn’t working out. So why don’t we actually try something a bit more in line with your preferences then, Ilunor?” I turned towards the Vunerian expectantly, his eyes narrowing as his grin widened into one of knowing anticipation. 

“I am glad you have evolved beyond your singular-tracked biases, Cadet Emma Booker. Let us begin then, shall we?”

…

**10 Minutes Later**

…

We’d left the confines of the ZNK-19 for the living room. Following which, Ilunor had begun bathing the space in yet another dazzling array of colors courtesy not of his sight seer, but his own illusion magic.

However, the whole room wasn’t exactly turned into a fully immersive magical hologram, as seen with the sight-seers.

Instead it remained as it was, except overlaid with what was rapidly becoming a complex array of colored ‘trails’. Superimposed waves of color that at certain places moved like soupy magma, while in other places looked almost akin to fast-moving and deadly pyroclastic flows. 

The spectrum of colors on display here even edged into ultraviolet, as the EVI helped to superimpose *that* atop of what was already a dizzying display.

By the end of it, I was faced with what I could only describe as a rave of fire and magma, as the room around us looked less like the stately and idyllic magical manor I was used to, and more akin to some post-apocalyptic interpretation of the living room.

What’s more, the space *around* Ilunor himself was now occupied by a larger, almost comical ‘shell’ of what I could only imagine was his ideal form. A shell that ebbed and flowed like the flames around a candle wick, but with the dimensions that roughly matched Qiv or even Auris’ forms, stretching and filling the empty space above and around Ilunor.

Streams of both lava and flames spewed from that ‘shell’ surrounding him, acting almost like tendrils that occasionally lapped at the pyroclastic flow circling him.

“*This* is what I see, Cadet Emma Booker.” The Vunerian beamed, causing me to raise a single questioning hand.

“Ilunor… exactly how *much* of this is artistic interpretation?”

That singular question was enough to break the shit-eating grin that had formed following this… explosion of illusions.

“You wanted an *analogue,* did you not, earthrealmer? Well, here it is. I am unwilling to compromise on my artistic vision, for a fool’s errand that is attempting to replicate that which is unreplicable to the manaless eye.” 

I blinked rapidly, turning to Thacea and Thalmin who had both gone into full facepalm mode.

“Right, step aside and let *me* try.” Thalmin bellowed out, moving in front of me and quickly casting Ilunor aside, causing the post-apocalyptic texture pack to disappear unceremoniously.

The man promptly began cracking his fingers, raising both hands above his head, before twiddling them in front of us.

From there, a stream of different colors soon came to paint the canvas that was our living room. 

Predominantly made up of shades of blue and translucent greys, Thalmin’s attempt was nowhere near as grandiose or ambitious as Ilunor’s. 

Either out of a difference in skill or an adherence to a more *realistic* approach, the lupinor’s interpretation of manasight consisted of what felt like a complex layering of literal *streams* of water, broken up by patches of surface ice that cracked and reformed all along rivers that snaked and slithered through every available empty space in the room. 

There were currents that moved faster, eddies where currents seemed chaotic, if not borderline violent, as well as parts of the ‘air’ where currents seemed almost frozen over.

Throughout all this, what seemed to be a strange pattern emerged, as the shell that had surrounded Ilunor was replicated here too in Thalmin’s demonstration. 

However, instead of the larger-than-life, ‘bulked up’ version of himself, Thalmin’s shell seemed to more resemble an outline. One that looked more akin to one of the EVI’s target ID reticles, but thicker, and much more dynamic with how it rose and fell with each and every breath. 

Indeed, instead of the flame-like wispiness of Ilunor’s ‘shell’, Thalmin’s felt much more calm, moving in predictable patterns that either lined up with his breathing or the manastreams surrounding him. 

“*This* is a much more accurate and true-to-life interpretation, Emma.” Thalmin remarked proudly, prompting the Vunerian to simply puff out a disapproving breath in response.

“Boring and uninspired.” He remarked.

“Reality cares not for your artistic interpretations, Ilunor.” The lupinor shot back.

“But I assure you, Prince Thalmin, that reality is most certainly not as colorblind as how you seem to interpret it through your manasight.”

This caused the pair to once again face off, only for their mini confrontation to be defused by Thacea who wordlessly moved between them.

“If I may?” She turned to the pair, who promptly broke off their aggressions with crossed arms. “Thank you.” The princess continued, before filling the room with *her* interpretation of the incorporeal world.

It started slowly, almost imperceptibly, even. But eventually I started to notice what was effectively a series of white, sketchy lines filling the air; the same sort of lines you’d see in weather maps depicting wind currents and weather systems. 

Indeed, there seemed to be much more of a refined *precision* to Thacea’s take on things, as clear demarcations were made with these sketchy lines, creating what was in effect a 3D version of an animated wind map, filling my vision and causing the EVI to actually *beep* in some sort of affirmation.

“This is what I believe to be best in your case, Emma. Indeed, while this is far less… true to life to what manastreams actually embody, this interpretation manages to impart the *chaos* that comes with how said streams influence one’s interpretation of the corporeal world.”

I raised an eyebrow at that, turning to both Ilunor and Thalmin in the process. “Is it actually this chaotic? Like, this is honestly giving me a bit of a headache here trying to make heads or tails of what’s going—”

“When you put it that way, it *can* be somewhat nausea-inducing.” Thalmin acknowledged. “However, all of us have acclimatized to it, I suppose.” He shrugged. “We can ignore it if need be, but most of the time, it’s merely another aspect of the world. So just as too much bedazzlement can make your head spin, there can always be too much or too little of what is effectively just another form of sight, if that makes sense.”

It was with each successive demonstration and explanation that I truly realized just how *difficult* this really was. Akin to describing sight, sound, touch, or any one of the senses to someone born without it. 

“Yeah, I guess I do.” I nodded in acknowledgement.

“In any case, the inherent issues with Ilunor and Thalmin’s interpretations is that they try to take into account the… *dynamic beauty* that comes with the manastreams. This beauty is highly subjective, and leaves quite a bit to interpretation and personal biases.”

“Which is why you went with the bare bones and ‘truest’ version of it.” I surmised.

“Precisely, Emma.” Thacea acknowledged with a sympathetic nod. 

“Can you work with this, EVI?” I turned towards the EVI, receiving an affirmative beep in the process as a progress bar was quickly added right beneath the motorcycle’s. 

“Well, that should be all then. I appreciate the input, guys.” I beamed back with a thumbs up, garnering a nod from Thacea, an approving smile from Thalmin, and the beginnings of yet another coy grin from Ilunor.

“It is unfortunate that *this* will be all you can appreciate.” The deluxe kobold remarked smugly. “You have my sympathies, Cadet Emma Booker, for forever being destined to lack insight into the integral *beauty* of the world.” 

I took a moment to regard the man, glaring at him through the lenses of the helmet. 

“I’m not the only one lacking in the ability to see the *world* beyond the corporeal, Ilunor.” I shot back.

“Oh? Why Cadet Emma Booker… there is no need to be so defensive over such matters. We must all know our limitations, after all.” 

“Yeah, and your limitation is clearly your constant inability to grasp that there’s *always* another side to every coin.” 

“Whatever do you mean by *that*, Cadet Emma Booker? I am discussing your disconnect from the incorporeal world, the noble sense that is manavision. What could you possibly have that can compare? It’s not as if you have an incorporeal world by which to ponder, appreciate, and…” The Vunerian trailed off, prompting me to simply bide my time with a few taps of my feet.

“Oh… this is bound to be good.” Thalmin chimed in.

…

**10 Minutes Later**

… 

“I’m sorry I have to do this, Thalmin.” I preemptively apologized, just as the ZNK-19 started revving up its pylons. “I promise this will be quick.” 

“If it’s a matter of countering Nexian primacy, then by all means, Emma.” Thalmin responded with a toothy grin, just as the world around us started materializing into a familiar sight.

The sounds of thousands of footsteps greeted us first, just as the rumbling of elevated rail and ringing cyclists welcomed us back into the Big Apple.

Midrise towers loomed over us this time around however, as did the interlaced ‘green zones’ that made New Brooklyn the model for what was then the ‘solarpunk’ third space movement. An aesthetic that was once a fad, but had now become just as integrated in Acela as art deco was to the old and new quarters.

“Well, earthrealmer? I see nothing but the city you have shown us previously. Your world is very much still as *dead* as the day you first showed it to us.” 

I didn’t reply, not immediately anyways, as I began booting up what I referred to as *first person mode*.

Nothing truly changed about our surroundings, at least, not in the *corporeal* world.

Instead, a familiar sight to most modern humans slowly crept up, starting with a loading screen, and then suddenly *exploding* into a full blown heads-up display. *My* heads-up display, to be precise; the augmented reality interface I mained back home.

Things started slowly at first, with only the time of day, certain push notifications, along with a small to-do list nesting themselves on the bottom right hand corner of the hologram.

From there, however, things slowly became increasingly more complex as we walked forward towards storefronts of local grocers and cafes alike. 

It was in one of those particular cafes, however, that I honed the POV’s focus, as the whole physical space was seamlessly integrated into various AR widgets present in my vision. From the soft outlines of the cafe’s bookstore, highlighting books on offer I’d bookmarked previously, all the way to active and public board game sessions that superimposed both animations and stats next to each physical miniature. I made sure to seamlessly show just how the physical world was complemented by an intangible *digital* one.

These displays prompted the Vunerian’s eyes and maw to widen, as he turned to me with not an incredulous sense of denial, but pure confusion.

“What… what are we *seeing*, earthrealmer? What are you showing us?”

I took a moment to pause, turning off the augmented reality enhanced version of the world, before turning it back on again, allowing the deluxe kobold to process *exactly* where I was going with this.

“Like I said, Ilunor, you’re not the only one with an *incorporeal world* to admire and interact with.” I spoke cryptically, before bringing out the POV back to the streets and moving forwards, bound towards one of the many transport hubs in the borough. 

I’d purposefully kept the AR HUD off throughout that entire time, waiting just for the right moment to turn it back on.

At which point, I probably gave Ilunor the same sensory overload he gave me earlier.

What was already a beautiful art deco-inspired elevated rail hub, suddenly *exploded* into a series of nested reticles and highlighted paths, detailing *everything* from timetables to the various lines that passed through the terminal. Each line was represented by a different color, with each train highlighted as they arrived. 

Menus came and went as I demonstrated just how *seamlessly* the incorporeal world could be cycled through, by anything from hand gestures to voice commands, or just by sight-tracking alone. 

“The major difference between our incorporeal worlds is probably the fact that we built ours from scratch, creating a second world entirely of our design. Sure, it’s not a completely *new* sense, but it’s an incorporeal world all the same, no?” I offered with a sly chuckle of my own, causing the Vunerian to simply go inert, his eyes hopping back and forth between the transient reticles, outlines, and readouts of anything and everything from public transport to civic announcements, and even the odd commercial for local businesses approved by the community councils. 

He didn’t respond, not right away at least, as it was clear he was grasping at straws behind those unblinking eyes — desperate for some sort of a comeback.

“I must reiterate a point I’ve made previously.” He began ominously. “That your kind, *needed* to build all of *this*, creating an entirely new facsimile of an incorporeal world… just to mimic a fraction of what *we* were gifted with.”

I crossed my arms at that rebuttal, cocking my head and tsking as I did so.

“Didn’t you once claim something about how your culture values the triumph of the sapient over nature? Or the creations of sapientkind as sacrosanct?”

“Yes? What about it—” The deluxe kobold paused mid sentence, as if realizing where I was going with this.

“Well, by that logic, wouldn’t that mean that *our* incorporeal world is actually much more impressive than your manasight? As in, we actually had to **build** every aspect of it, from the communications infrastructure, to the actual information being conveyed, to the science of *how* said information would be conveyed, to the laws in place to dictate *what* can be conveyed.” I paused, winding up for the final knock-out punch. “We basically had to create our own incorporeal world *from scratch*, with nothing but our imagination and creativity, our *gifts of sapiency*. So technically, by your own logic, wouldn’t *that* be a feat far more impressive than some *naturally-gifted* ability?” 

Ilunor paused, turning away to the skies as if to find some respite… only to see the shuttles and planes overhead outlined by thin glowing lines, accompanied by their relevant flight tracking information. 

“It is a matter of our inherent…” The man attempted to counter, only to shirk away in frustration. “You’ve made your point earthrealmer. But just know, this is *not* the same as manasight.”

“You stated earlier that such things are highly subjective, and leaves a lot to both interpretation and personal biases, right?” I began as I broke out a cheeky smile. “That is to say, beauty’s just in the eye of the beholder, huh?” 

Ilunor refused to respond verbally.

Instead, the only response I received was in the form of the hologram’s integrity wavering, as soot from the Vunerian’s frustrated face started to obscure the impossible world around us.

(Author's Note: Hey everyone! I apologize for the slight delay today! I had to take my mom to the hospital earlier today because of an unexpected emergency. A bug somehow crawled into and got stuck in her ear, so we had to get it removed. She's alright now though! :D But yeah! I got to start exploring a part of the world I've been hinting at for a long time in this chapter! Primarily with regards to manasight and how the rest of the gang see the world! It's something that I've eluded to before, but we're finally starting to see Emma fully butting heads with a world she can't perceive as a result of her lacking manasight! However, the WAID does offer at least some hope of one day at least perceiving some elements of it. Beyond that though, Emma finally got to show off a part of our world that is to an extent analogous to manasight. What's more though, it's an entirely novel world of our creation, which Emma points out to Ilunor as an argument against his logical assertions of superiority. But yeah! I really do hope you guys enjoy the chapter! :D **The next Two Chapters are already up on Patreon if you guys are interested in getting early access to future chapters.**)

2023-02-05 17:05:38,"Wearing Power Armor to a Magic School (16/?) [First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/yd3cu3/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_1/) | [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/10ocjtv/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_15/) | [Next](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/110kkgh/wearing_power_armor_to_a_magic_school_17/)

I’d expected panic to envelope the room. A *generalized* surge of mana-radiation wasn’t something to be trifled with, no. In fact, it spelled *danger* in every sense of the word.

The training I received on the mana-radiation sensory analytics and detection system (M-RSADS), had placed great emphasis on delineating between each specific *category* of warning. Indeed, whilst the scientists and engineers back at home had a penchant for overcomplicating things, this particular system was completely off-limits to their shenanigans. It was a classic case of the end-user finally getting their way, and one of the many times the military elements within the IAS had sunk their heels in to make sure the overly eager scientists didn’t get too lost in their own sauce.

Intuitiveness and practicality was the name of the game here, because this whole system was a matter of life and death. *Not* a matter of desk-bound data analytics.

This was how the broad-strokes, two-category system of mana radiation detection was born.

If the scientists had their way, there would be literally *hundreds* more, but thankfully I only had two to worry about.

The reason behind *why* the two-category system was chosen, was rather expectedly, a matter of practicality. Simply put, it allowed me to rapidly assess and evaluate the threat posed by mana-radiation, and how best to respond accordingly.

Localized surges were bursts of mana-radiation with a specific point of origin that the suit’s sensors could definitively locate. There was a discrete radius of effect, and a clear-cut path towards either dealing with the source of the radiation or simply booking it out of there as fast as the suit’s powered exoskeleton and jump-packs could manage.

Generalized surges however, were an entirely different beast. As the name would suggest, all a generalized surge was, was a surge in mana-radiation *without* a specific point of origin. There was no clear radius of effect as the *entire* extent of the suit’s sensors would be bathed in a consistent, uninterrupted increase in background mana-radiation with no discernible point where the radiation drops off. Understandably, this was the worst possible scenario to be in, because neither fight nor flight protocols could be undertaken. For there was no clear area to flee *to*, and no particular point of origin to neutralize.

I was thus, beyond relieved that this surge of mana radiation lasted for but a whopping grand total of two and a half seconds.

“There is no need to be alarmed.” The shrill voice of the apprentice echoed throughout the massive expanse of the room. “The ebbs and flows of the Academy’s manastreams are stronger than what you might be accustomed to back in your home realms. Such occurrences are normal and to be expected, as but part of the Academy’s unwavering adherence to the unending odyssey that is the scholarly pursuit of the magical arts. Take this as the first unofficial lesson, pay no mind and carry on.”

The apprentice soon stood up, gathering her belongings and adjusting her cloak. “You are to be dismissed, but do recall the rules and make certain to observe the etiquette of the Academy’s grace period. Remain within the common areas, stay exclusively within the designated spaces, and take this time as a necessary respite prior to the commencement of your studies.”

Without much in the way of fanfare, the elf soon quickly made a b-line for one of the side exits. The harsh clacking of her reasonably practical boots reverberated with each hurried step she took, her path on a direct course to pass by our table.

With all pretenses of social decorum and court etiquette thrown completely out the window, I stood up, and effectively blocked the elf’s path with the sheer presence of my armor.

“I don’t think we’ve been properly acquainted.” I announced, attempting to make up for the lack of social etiquette like a bandaid on a gaping wound. “There’s something urgent that requires the attention of the faculty, and I assume you’re the right person to relay my concerns to them.” I tried my very best to hold back on going all-in on the accusations and the obvious finger pointing. If this *was* someone with solid connections to the top, yet was grounded enough to have eschewed whatever noble titles that came with it, there was a chance I’d misjudged her from the previous night. There was a chance I could at least have some sort of a working relationship with her.

“Emma of Earthrealm, this isn’t the time or place for such *pleasantries*, there are urgent matters I must attend to-”

“Like that surge in mana.” I interjected.

“I am not at liberty, nor do I have the time to entertain any of your newrealmer concerns. At least not at this instance. Now please, I have urgent matters concerning Academy affairs I must attend post-haste.” She attempted to skirt past me, and was just about to if it wasn’t for Thacea’s entry into the conversation.

“Honorable Apprentice, the newrealmer wishes to invoke a point of personal privilege.” Thacea spoke without even attempting to stand up, not even so much as turning to face the apprentice in question. Instead, she remained sat at the table, her eyes trained forward towards her half eaten breakfast in calm contemplation. “You must excuse her brashness, esteemed peer. It is, after all, unreasonable to expect a newrealmer to properly invoke or even recognize the proper calls to decorum. So, if you would please, I would most certainly *prefer* her calls to privilege be respected by an official entity of the Academy.” The last sentence came off as something halfway between a suggestion, an order, and a request. It was that careful balance of suggestive authority that was difficult to really nail, but given Thacea’s royal heritage I could only assume it was practically second nature to her now.

The apprentice all but halted in her tracks at that, her eyes seemed to shift from an expression of urgency and annoyance to one of apprehension and genuine unease. Her tone of voice changed drastically as she addressed me again. This time, that dismissive and frankly patronizing tone had all but vanished, now replaced by a more reasonable, level-toned cadence with an undertone of frustration. “Of course, princess. Emma Booker of Earthrealm, my affairs should be concluded within the early hours of the afternoon. Should you wish to pursue your point of personal privilege, I shall be in the castle’s main garden. Ask Groundskeeper Alaton for my exact whereabouts, I shouldn’t be more than a hundred paces from the castle at any given time.” The elf adjusted her cloak once more, followed by a nervous cough. “Now, I must take my leave.” She spoke as she bid our entire table a half-nod before exiting the room.

In those precious few seconds before she reached for the door, I made a call that could only be described as impulsive, and driven purely by my gut instinct.

Tapping a few physical hotkeys on my wrist-mounted data-pad, with target reticules trained on the apprentice highlighting her entire form in a glowing orange, I released one of the many toys I had at my disposal.

“*INFIL-DRONE01 ACTIVE, STATUS: NOMINAL. OBJECTIVE: PRIORITY TRACKING AND RECONNAISSANCE OF SUBJECT\_01. MISSION PARAMETERS: PENDING…”*

“Track, observe, and return-to-base. Take no chances. Set minimum acceptable risk of compromise to the lowest default settings.” I spoke rapidly, relaying the drone’s mission parameters.

The dragonfly-like drone barely the size of the tip of my finger zipped right out of its docking bay from one of my suit’s many compartments and trailed behind the apprentice, exiting through the tiny space left in the door just before it swung shut.

With a long exhale having committed to a mission based solely off of my gut instinct, I sat back down at the table, and began the process of connecting the nutripaste tube to my OIP.

“Emma.” Thacea spoke up, her voice colored by an undertone of audible frustration.

“Yes, Thacea?”

“How much time do we have left?”

I immediately knew what she was talking about as I quickly glanced at the countdown timer on my HUD. “61 hours, 54 minutes, and 37 seconds.”

The princess seemed to take this into careful consideration, glancing over at a golden orb connected via a chain to her cloak jacket. The object glowed with a dull yellow hue, blinking with each second that passed. “After you finish your breakfast, let us make haste with our plans for the afternoon, and make the most out of the rest of this morning.”

I was just about to nod, and to move towards agreeing with Thacea if it wasn’t for Ilunor suddenly perking up and addressing all of us first. “The rest of this morning? I’m afraid I have more pressing matters to attend to.” The Vunerian jumped off of his seat and onto the marble floors with a loud *clack*.

“What affairs could you possibly have?” Thalmin growled out in a fit of annoyance.

“Personal affairs. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ll be in the dorms if and when my business is concluded.” Ilunor explained without a hint of hesitation as he began walking off, eventually blending in with the slow trickle of students leaving out through the main door.

“Laziness.” Thalmin huffed in between bites of smoked meats and pastries. “Laziness to the rotten thing’s core.” He continued in between large and unrestrained mouthfuls of carefully presented cold-cuts. “That’s all this is about. Trust me, he’ll be walking to the dorms for a post-breakfast nap before waking up for lunch and repeating the cycle for dinner.”

With that bizarre turn of events out of the way, I now turned towards Thacea. “Right, so, next order of business, I think we should find a productive way to kill time between now and the afternoon’s meeting. I say we take the initiative, and track down the crate ourselves for now. It’s a longshot, but I'm thinking of roaming the halls with my scanner on full blast just in case we run into it in a hallway or something.”

“Considering that there is no other course of action for us to take at the present, I am inclined to agree.” Thacea nodded in approval.

“Erm, quick question, can you deploy the whole noise cancellation suppression field thing while on the move as well?” I quickly asked.

“Yes. It requires a more advanced version of the spell but it’s within my capabilities. Why do you ask?” Thacea inquired with a cock of her head.

“There’s erm, something you need to know that I think you should hear after breakfast. We can talk about it while we’re on the move.” I spoke as I finally committed to the gut churning process of introducing the tube of paste to my OIP, the airlocks and pneumatics whirring away as that familiar taste of *shredded beef in barbecue sauce* in a chunky toothpaste consistency filled my mouth.

=====

**The Transgracian Academy for the Magical Arts, First Floor Grand Concourse, Secondary Corridor. Local Time: 1000 Hours.**

“You what?!” Thacea yelled, or rather, *squawked* out incredulously.

“I, well, I decided on deploying a drone to keep tabs on the apprentice. I don’t trust the whole: ‘*this burst of mana radiation is just a common occurance’* thing, it just doesn’t sit right with me. It’s all too convenient. A huge burst like that followed with her getting up and leaving? There has to be something to it, and I have a massive hunch it has something to do with my crate.” I explained emphatically.

“Emma… the risks involved with that decision are far beyond what I would be comfortable entertaining as a mere thought experiment, let alone an actual spur-of-the-moment decision.” The avian explained, clearly holding back her desires to verbally dress me down. “The Nexus, and by extension the Academy, are masters at espionage and subterfuge. To try to challenge them at a game they are adept in is a foolish, and frankly, senseless undertaking.” The princess’ plumage puffed up and down, ruffling between each cycle. There was little doubt that this was something *way* outside her comfort zone, as we tread deeper into uncharted territory.

I allowed Thacea to just *breathe* for a few moments after that panicked response before I finally responded.

“You’re completely right, Thacea.” I nodded deeply. “I don’t doubt the veracity of any one of your claims for a second.” I continued, speaking with an unfiltered sincerity that was causing the avian to raise what I assumed was her equivalent of an eyebrow. “The Nexus *must* be good at what they do if they’ve lasted for what, tens of thousands of years? I can’t compete with that. Heck, I *know* for a fact I have no chance at beating them at their own game. It’s impossible for me to wage war against something so much larger, so much wiser, so much more refined in their skill sets and methods.”

“But here’s the thing.” I soon shifted gears, as confidence and cockiness began to fill the cracks left behind by that agreeable sincerity. “I don’t *need* to. Because I’m not waging the same war they’re waging, nor am I playing the same games they’re playing. I’m setting up for a whole other game here, Thacea. One with a completely different set of rules, and one with a completely different set of criteria for victory. It’s a game the Nexus has never once touched, but that my people have had *thousands* of years to fine-tune and perfect.” I took a deep breath before continuing. “I don’t doubt for a fact that I can’t compete at the Nexus by their rules, but the same can be said for the Nexus’ ability to play by *my* rules. So whilst I do agree, my decision to send that drone out *was* brash, it was a calculated move on my part that I felt was an acceptable risk given the context involved.”

It was with that, that I let out a large sigh, awaiting Thacea’s response.

A response which never came as a warning lit up inside of my suit’s helmet.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 200% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

**PRIORITY ALERT: WARNING INCOMING PROJECTILE**

My training kicked in, around the same time my suit decided that it needed to intervene on my behalf as the improvised projectile was brought up on-screen, and I felt my head and neck forcibly shunted to the right by the augmented rapid-reaction measures courtesy of the suit’s exoskeleton.

I narrowly evaded the unknown object in a blink of an eye.

But it wasn’t over yet.

**PRIORITY ALERT: PROJECTILE (NO DATABASE REGISTRY… N/A: DESIG\_UAO1) ON INTERCEPT TRAJECTORY. PERMISSION TO ENGAGE? Y/N?**

The damn thing took another swoop at me, yet this time aimed for my legs instead, as it carried out an incessant series of pass-bys.

I refused to use the gauntlet canons to deal with this, so on one of its last approaches, I reached up a single arm and swiped it right out of the sky. My hands clenched the damn thing tightly, crumpling it up into a compressed ball.

It was then that my mind finally registered what it actually was.

The texture it conveyed through my glove’s haptic feedback systems was unmistakable.

It was paper.

The damn thing was a paper bird animated by mana

This was a grade-school level attempt at messing with me.

It didn’t take long for the perpetrators behind this whole childish escapade to make themselves known, as a series of condescending claps echoed from around the corner, followed by the appearance of a group of 4 students each dressed to their nines in their noble attire.

Two of the four I immediately recognized from the previous night. The gorn-like reptilian Lord Qiv who volunteered to be first on the chopping block, and the unfortunate bear-like biped, Uven Kroven who was chosen soon after.

Qiv was very much still dressed in a manner akin to the previous night, with that cape covering much of the silken tunic and the dispelling amulet underneath.

Uven, meanwhile, had donned a simpler set of clothes. A deep brown leather cloak that covered a more vibrant wave-like pattern tunic and pants underneath, with what seemed to be a broach resembling a set of three paws on the right side of the cloak’s high-collar.

“Well, well, well… it seems as if our great knight lives up to her reputation after all.” Qiv spoke in a manner that was *drenched* with a level of haughty superiority that not even Ilunor could match.

“I must say, with that hand-eye coordination and those rapid-reflexes, indeed… with how *naturally* she leaped for the *Podgy-Pa*, one must assume she comes from a realm of primates!” One of the other students within the group spoke, this one looked eerily bat-like, with heavy drape-like webbing underneath her arms.

“Oh, be reasonable Airit, we cannot yet assume what species she must be, only that the results of this experiment heavily infers her commoner heritage. To be able to reach up to grab prey in such a manner is a skill that only those who subsist day by day must master. This is confirmation as to her commoner status if anything.” The last in the group quickly added. This one was small, smaller than even Ilunor, standing at a whopping 3 feet tall, and from the looks of it resembled a well-kept humanoid rat, or perhaps a hamster.

“What do you say, Uven?” The hamster turned to the Ursina, who seemed to be zoned out of his mind as he merely shrugged in response, his eyes were clearly open but they betrayed the fact that no one was home.

“It’s just mana-sickness, don’t worry about him.” The bat-like Airit reasoned, as all eyes were once more focused on me. “I say this experiment might even be quite telling as to the state of her realm. The armor is a showpiece, and her abilities to reach for prey, betrays just how destitute and lacking her realm must truly be. If the *chosen one* of a new realm is accustomed to such lesser skills, just imagine what the rest of it must be like!”

The bat and hamster pair giggled amongst themselves, whilst the reptilian Qiv maintained a careful, calculating gaze on me and the princess behind me.

To say that I was at a loss for words would be an understatement. To be honest I was expecting something akin to this eventually happening if I were to take anything from Ilunor’s entire schtick. But to have an entire gang coming down on me with the intensity and competitiveness of a gold medal finalist in the field of mental gymnastics was something I just wasn’t ready for.

“You guys aren’t even going to try a *Hello*, maybe even a *Hi, welcome to the neighborhood*?” I managed out with an exasperated sigh.

“Oh, we reserve that for our fellow lords and ladies, it’s customary for commoners to greet their betters, not the other way around.” The bat spoke with a heavy series of chitterings. “But I do not hold it against you, newrealmer. If you have yet to have developed a civilization capable enough of understanding the principles of the *perpetual regime*, then how can I cast judgment? Why, I would be no better than a common fool yelling at a stray mutt for its lack of obedience training. Ignorance can only be tempered by knowledge and education, and I along with the rest of my peers, are more than willing to be the avatars of an enlightened nobility.”

I took a series of careful, controlled, breaths.

In, and out.

In, and out.

My anger and frustration wouldn’t overtake me, and it wouldn’t ruin my mission on day *two*.

I weighed my options carefully, my mind running through every possible scenario as I decided on a diplomatic way out of this quagmire, only to have yet *another* alarm beep at me.

This time, it was something *much* more important.

*“Alert. Priority Notice: INFIL-DRONE01 signal detected. Status: returning to designated point-of-origin. Reason for premature mission abortion: calculated risk of compromised status beyond maximum acceptable threshold.”*

“Let’s double-time it back to the dorms.” I turned to both Thacea and Thalmin without any hesitation.

With a nod of affirmation between the three of us, we took off back to the dorms in a hurried sprint, leaving the crowd of *enlightened nobles* in the dust.“Hmmph, so not only are we dealing with a lowly commoner, but a *coward* as well. At least she knows not to challenge her natural betters.” Was all I heard before the audio-sensors cut off as we turned the corner.

=====

**Dragon’s Heart Tower, Level 23, Residence 30. Front Door. Local Time: 1020 Hours.**

If true AI wasn’t a taboo, and if the drone could actually *think*, I could imagine it’d be screaming down the halls with how eager it was to show me everything it’d discovered.

Upon arrival at the dorms we were met with the dragonfly like drone actively crawling underneath the door frame. It wasn’t long however as I arrived that it backtracked and flew right towards me, on a flightpath that would’ve made a younger version of me scream in disgust, but that elicited nothing from me now other than a quick flinch from my buried yet still latent entomophobia.

Much to the horror of my peers, the drone quickly crawled and shimmied its way into one of my many utility pouches. After which, it made a wired connection with the suit proper. The data-transfer that occurred concurrently with the recharge of the drone was near-instantaneous. Wired connections were, even after all these years, the preferable, quickest, and most reliable means of information transfer after all.

“Emma. Let’s get inside before we add *whisperer of arachnids* into your list of titles.” Thalmin urged as he opened the door and led all of us inside.

Upon entry into the room, I immediately made a b-line for the couch, promptly downloaded all of the files onto my data-tab, and had Thacea blot out the world using her whole noise privacy shield spell thing.

It didn’t take long before the relevant files were played, the video fast-forwarding until it slowed down to normal speed just as the apprentice arrived on scene into what I could only describe was a room, or what was left of it.

The scene that I was faced with was nothing short of a disaster. The room, if it could still be called that, was a mess of pockmarked holes and molten rock. The lights within flickered every few seconds in a manner almost eerily reminiscent of the fluorescent lights of old. What should have been the Academy’s signature gaudy tables, chairs, and various other appointed articles of limited practical use were either smashed, cleaved cleanly, or in some way mutilated beyond their original state.

Yet despite the whole room looking as if it’d just gone through an active warzone, akin to a scene straight out of the war-docs from New Terra, no one seemed to really mind. Indeed, the devastation wrought upon it was almost immediately reverted as soon as the drone’s cameras laid eyes on it. Those pockmarked holes oozing with magma and molten rock? They all but hardened and solidified over the course of a few short seconds. The flickering lights from the unseen light-emmitting-crystals? They’d stabilized moments after that. The furnishings that had been wrecked seemingly beyond repair? Well, those seemed to have just… pulled themselves together. *Literally*. From the tables crushed beyond recognition to the chairs whose upholstery had all but been strewn across the floors, whatever scrap, shard, or splinter belonged to the item in question had simply been *pulled* back to whatever the largest piece of it remained, before it just put itself back together.

The camera quickly panned over to scan several of the figures present within the far edge of the room. Several faces were isolated and successfully cross-referenced using the tablet’s database. Mal’tory, Vanavan, the red robed and white robed professors, and strangely enough, a bear-like figure with a face obscured by shadow, dressed in a heavy leather cloak with a distinct broach resembling three-paws affixed to its high collar.

Eventually, as the dust finally settled, and the incoherent chatter of voices within the room droned out into discernable, distinct voices that the drone could effectively isolate, so too did another familiar object make itself known once more. As in the middle of the entire room, having previously been obscured by the dust, debris, and steam hissing from the molten lava-pit of a floor, was a plinth. And upon that plinth, was the book from the binding ritual, currently open to a page with the names of all of the students from the night prior.

A strange implement was attached firmly to the book. It looked like someone had taken a bear-trap and clamped it onto either side of it, then attached one of those two-axis gantries, and bracketed it horizontally to one side of the page. Further, it looked like a magnifying glass affixed to it highlighting small patches of text within the book.

Zooming in closer towards the strange device, a name could just about be made out, as the camera held still and stabilized on that half-hearted attempt at cursive.

*Emma Booker*.

*“Only one being I see as the one true god above gods; His Eternal Majesty.”*

The entire room suddenly echoed with the sounds of a hundred chairs being forcibly pushed across a variety of surfaces, Auris Ping now leading the charge as a bright ear-to-ear grin manifested itself across his snout. “Forever may he reign!”

“***Forever may he reign!***” The whole room repeated, before promptly sitting back down in a flurry of cacophonous noises.

A knowing look was exchanged between the likes of Ping and Articord after that sudden call for reverence, a glance that seemed to cement an underlying narrative that had formed since his first non-sequitur question about the gods.

“Is there a reason why you insist on bringing up the topic of these idols of a dead world, Lord Ping?” Articord prompted as soon as the last hair-raising, neck-tingling echoes of the scraping of chairs finally died down.

“Yes, professor.” Auris replied without hesitation. “I do so, out of love and faith for the sanctity of His Eternal Majesty.” The man spoke with a fiery zeal and vitriol, without even the faintest hint of faltering from complete and utter devotion.

“By calling upon for further elaboration on the role of the old gods?” The professor shot back, although this time, there was something of a sing-song cadence to her voice. As if she was fully embracing the *theater* — as Ilunor would call it — between herself and the bull.

“History is nothing if not the acknowledgement of the failures of the past, to better improve ourselves in the pursuit of the present, in securing a certain and unwavering future. The story of His Eternal Majesty cannot be told in full without first establishing the story of the Old Gods which preceded him in the Eras of Folly. For only the full truth, the *whole* truth, can cast away the shadows of ignorance and free the mind from the shackles of self-delusion.” The bull’s eyes never once wavered, never once flinched, his whole body stood tall and unmoving as I could audibly hear how this speech was given with even more candidness than before; if that was even possible. “All shadows of doubt will wither and falter at the foot of the light of the gospel of the Enlightened Regime.”

The professor took a moment to regard Auris’ words with an appreciative smile. A rare instance of being not only *satisfied* by an answer like she was with Ilunor’s, but instead being genuinely impressed.

“The truth can be difficult for many to comprehend, Lord Ping. I say this, as someone who has made the pilgrimage of shadows.” The professor admitted through that same polite smile. “With that being said, in any other instance, I would’ve gladly started off with said truths. However, today, as with many things with your year group; the situation is radically *different* by virtue of those that comprise your ranks.” It was clear, even without a stray glance, that she was talking about me. “The best education is often personalized education, accounting for the needs of every type of student. I have tailored today’s *opening lesson* to reflect this fact.”

Silence descended upon the room following the professor’s statement. All gazes rested on the fox as her eyes seemed to be scouring for her next prey, her next subject of interest.

Me.

“Newrealmer.” Articord announced suddenly, her voice dripping not with any spite or self-righteousness, but an earnest tone of curiosity. “Cadet Booker, is it?”

“Yes, professor.” I replied with a nod.

“As a newrealmer, I understand you may have quite a few questions, such is the nature of innocence from reason, and the regrettable state of affairs that is the squalid ignorance of the natural state. However, I can infer based on the mere fact that you sit here — having crossed the threshold — that you are indeed *capable* of comprehending and adopting the principles of enlightened civility. You are… a pioneer of sorts, Cadet Booker. In the same way that the first followers of His Eternal Majesty’s enlightened circle took that leap of faith in setting forth into a previously uncharted future, so too are you doing the same by your mere presence. However-” The professor paused, taking a few steps forward up the still-invisible central walkway towards my equally-invisible desk. “-this ignorance goes both ways. For as much as you are ignorant to the ways of the Nexus, so too am I ignorant of the ways of your realm. So please, if you will allow me to indulge in my curiosities, I would like to ask you a few questions. Just to aid in the crossing of this river of ignorance on a bridge of mutual understanding.”

I was… taken aback by the shift in the professor’s angle.

Because whilst she started off with that typical Mal’tory-grade blanket statement of superiority, she didn’t follow through with it. More than that, she more or less left most pretenses of that posturing behind, the further she went in her monologue.

And in a move that no other professor had done so far, she even went so far as to publicly express her humility, and a desire to bridge that cultural gap for the alleged sake of mutual understanding; something that SIOP authors would’ve *fawned* over if they were here.

“Of course, professor.” I replied tactfully, politely, at the very least reciprocating the courtesy she was extending to me. “Fire away.”

There was probably a Nexian catch somewhere.

However… that remained to be seen, and I wasn’t about to actively reject a gesture of good will if I could help it.

“Do you believe in fate, Cadet Booker?” The professor asked candidly, throwing a curveball of a question without so much as flinching; her voice never once revealing anything other than an earnest and well-intentioned cadence.

“That’s a question that’s been debated amongst my kind for countless generations, since the inception of the spoken word itself, professor.” I replied diplomatically, SIOP training kicking in almost out of instinct as I felt like I was hitting the ground running. “Given the cosmopolitan and diverse nature of my people, and the policy of my government to accommodate and facilitate, rather than to impose and to dictate, I cannot say for certain whether or not I do.”

“Are you answering this as a representative of your people, or as you *yourself*, Cadet Booker?” The professor drilled further, not yet diving into a heated tone of voice, but more so straddling the line between impatience and a cordial sort of academic curiosity.

“That is my answer as a representative of my people, professor.” I answered curtly.

“Then allow me to rephrase my question, Cadet Booker. Do you, yourself, *not* your government, not your elders or kings or dukes or barons, not even your military superiors up in your chain of command… do *you* believe in fate?”

I took a moment to regard that question, as conflicts of interests arose between a desire to remain diplomatic, a desire to meet the professor’s question with honesty and upfrontness, as well as a desire to heed Thacea’s cautioning — to remain steadfast in ensuring a certain degree of ‘social face’ was preserved if at all possible. These desires however ended up stirring a bigger question that dwelled within me. A question that I hadn’t really put much thought into before, save for that one year of my life I’d rather forget.

“Not necessarily, professor.” I answered truthfully.

“*Not necessarily?*” The professor parroted back. “Elaborate, Cadet Booker.”

I let out a sigh. “On one hand, my faith sort of touches on the issues surrounding fate. However, on the other hand, it also emphasizes that a lot of things are ultimately up to you to decide as a person. Which means that at the end of the day, it’ll be the universe that’s reacting to you, rather than the universe dictating anything in particular; with cosmic and karmic forces and such reacting to your actions depending on what you do. Ultimately though, I personally believe that every individual’s fate is theirs to decide. Freedom is a fundamental aspect of the sapient condition after all, free will being part of that.”

I half-expected the professor to do a complete one-eighty, to pull an Auris Ping in the middle of the class to simply call me out on my beliefs.

But she didn’t.

Instead, she seemed to regard every word with intense fascination, cupping her entire lower face within her palm.

“Fascinating.” Was her first response following those few seconds of silence, her eyes only once breaking contact as if to actively ponder my words in her own mind for a bit. “We share quite a lot in common then, Cadet Booker.” She spoke soon after, with a sense of genuine intrigue that bordered on preachy but never quite crossed that line. “Because ultimately, there is one core fundamental principle which separates the past nine epochs from our current, eternal one. A fundamental belief, and a tangible truth, that lies at the very heart of each of these failures of the mortal realm. And that is the acknowledgement of the Enlightened Truth: that we should as much obliterate ourselves from the animal, as we should from those forces which bind our fates to the realm of the ‘gods’.”

A pause punctuated that statement, as it took me a good few moments, perhaps a full minute to really process what was being said.

This was because everything she was saying conflicted with every single one of my expectations of not just the Nexus, but a fantasy-esque realm in general.

“The former is self-explanatory-” The professor continued. “-in that as sapient beings, we should embrace our sapiency in order to truly self-actualize. It is our attachments to the traits of the animal, which prevents us from higher callings, and ultimately can lead us astray from the path of enlightenment. A life lived in the shadow of the calling of the animal and its instincts, is no better than a life of non-sapiency, after all. The latter topic regarding fates and the gods however, is a tad more complex. A topic which I have yet to touch upon, but one that seems to reflect well on your own beliefs, Cadet Booker.” Articord continued in that polite, almost excitable tone before turning back to the board, and the magical hologram around us.

Time seemed to rewind without any warning, as the ruins of ancient empires rose back up, only to be dismantled brick by brick as the professor pushed the timeline back all the way to what appeared to be the first ‘epoch’, back towards the start of that first town, and what looked to be a nondescript place of worship. It resembled a cathedral, but not in the typical way. Instead built around what seemed to be an impossibly large tree acting as its central ‘spire’.

We eventually found ourselves within this structure, facing the walls that seemed to be a mismatch of overgrowth and brick, with the vines themselves pulsating with every hum of prayer from the thousands of wood elves around us.

“But before we proceed, I first have a question for the floor.” Articord turned down the volume of the environmental sounds around us, reducing the hums and hymns to barely a whisper. “What does a ‘god’ ultimately *want*? What are the goals of these… *beings* that inhabit the immaterial realm of the ‘divine’?”

This line of question ultimately resulted in more than a handful of hands to be raised.

With all the main suspects holding their respective grounds with a competitive glare.

“Lord Qiv?” Articord announced.

“Worship.” He spoke confidently. “Worship for worship’s sake. Without care, without concern, without even the barest of hints or a modicum of decency for the sapients which see them for more than what they are.”

The professor’s eyes seemed to glaze over at that response at first, but eventually sharpened at the very last few words of that answer.

“Elaborate, Lord Qiv.”

“They are *not* actual ‘gods’, Professor. They are merely egotistical beings inhabiting a realm that just so happens to have properties which allow them a greater degree of power and movement above the mortal realm.” The gorn-like lizard continued on with a prideful grin.

Only to have it shot down without the barest hint of mercy from the fox professor.

“Poetry can only take you so far, Lord Qiv. I require answers based on *fact*, not a colorful retelling of the truth.” Articord spoke with a not-so-hidden frown of disappointment, further colored by a tone of barely-contained annoyance.

Qiv’s features for the first time shifted to one of concern, clearly afraid of the consequences of this ‘inappropriate’ answer.

But the docking of points never came.

Instead, the professor moved on just as quickly.

Next, to Etholin.

“Lord Esila?”

“They want power, professor.” The little ferret bowed his head down as he spoke. “Power, derived from the mortal realm, in the form of amusement. They *compete* in their own games within their elevated stations, removed and completely detached from the suffering they cause.”

Silence hung in the air after that answer, as the professor once more reached for her temples to sooth what looked like an oncoming migraine.

“There we go again.” She spoke with frustration. “More and more *embellishments* added to a historical tale that requires none.”

Etholin’s features immediately darkened, as he too looked as if he was about to slink down beneath the desk.

“The next person who answers *incorrectly*, will find that I do not wish to entertain *half-truths*. As it currently stands, I will *tolerate* these interpretations. For it is in the essence of the less disciplined mind to be more susceptible to the draw of colorful embellishments, rather than to accept the more nuanced historical truth. Moreover, misconceptions *abound* on the truth behind the seemingly obvious, and it is clear that many of you seem to be of the *less-inclined* to analyze history in its various retellings.”

Almost all hands retracted following that warning. All, save for four.

Airit,

Auris,

Ilunor,

And Thacea.

The latter two having once again locked eyes in agreement, as if instinctively *knowing* what each was about to say.

Surprisingly, the professor chose the deluxe kobold.

The small thing standing up tall and proud atop of his seat, hands triumphantly posed by his sides.

“Lord Rularia?”

“They want *nothing*, professor.” The blue thing spoke with a sense of epicness and grandeur.

One that immediately brought on the frustrated expression of the professor… but was soon overpowered by a sense of genuine intrigue in the form of a followup question.

“Elaborate, Lord Rularia.”

“Well… you can’t expect a *thing*, a force of nature, to really have *desires* now can you?” He grinned menacingly, bringing every ounce of that smarmy self-absorbed ego to bear.

I looked on, absolutely *horrified* by this cocky move, empathizing with the gang now with how they probably saw my own daring stunts.

Yet instead of seeing a thousand points docked from the group, I instead saw the professor’s lips once more forming into a smile.

“Lord Rularia, I will give you one more chance to elaborate before I invoke a Partition of Points. Elaborate on your answer.”

“The so-called ‘gods’ can want nothing. For they simply cannot be considered as sapient, as you or I.” He started. “A non-sapient, can neither *want* nor *desire* anything, and thus it would be foolish to consider otherwise.”

The professor dwelled on this answer for a few moments, her eyes scrunching up, before letting out a sigh.

“I invoke a Partition of Points.” She spoke, much to Ilunor’s shock, before turning to Auris Ping. “Lord Ping?”

“You humble me with your grace, professor.” Ping began with a deep bow, before rising up with a confidence he’d lost back in Vanavan’s class. “Lord Rularia… is *correct* in his assertions, and indeed, I *applaud* him for such an accurate and candid retelling. Such is to be expected from a member of the Nexian nobility.” He regarded Ilunor with a brief nod, the Vunerian reciprocating cautiously, before continuing. “These so-called ‘gods’, are in fact, merely a force of nature. As meaningless as the forests beyond the Academy’s walls, and as meaningless as the unmoving clouds that blanket these skies. They are thus, non-sapient, and they are thus… not capable of *wanting* anything. This is true… until you ascribe *meaning* to their non-sapience. Which those in the prior nine epochs *did*. Moreover, they constructed entire faiths around these so-called ‘gods’, ascribed virtues, values, and built entire *fictions* around their supposed teachings. Simply put, the more and more these false-faiths and deluded minds imbued these ‘divine forces’ with values and beliefs, the more these ‘beings’ reciprocated by mimicking them. These… so-called ‘gods’, were merely *mimics*, cheap impersonations of the sapient condition, parroting and repeating actions and words that they do not understand.”

This answer. This… *revelation*… hung in the air for barely a few seconds before Articord responded. And unlike Vanavan’s wishy-washy personality, she was very clearly bold with her response to Ping’s statements.

There was no mention of *semantics* here.

Only cold and hard fervent belief.

“Fifty points to this partition.” The professor spoke clearly, eliciting the gasps and shocked breaths of a hundred students. “And considering both of your answers, I declare this to be an *equal* partition. Twenty-five points to Lord Rularia, and twenty-five points to Lord Ping.”

No one dared to say anything, but it was clear even from here that Qiv was visibly stirring in his own way.

The little scaly ‘ridge’ atop of his head seemed to scrunch up, if only by a bit.

Auris, however, was seemingly not done. As another raised hand prompted the professor to sigh, before acknowledging his request.

“Yes, Lord Ping?”

“Professor, if I may. I have a personal point of *courtesy* to provide for the likes of Lord Ratom and Lord Esila.”

“Proceed, Lord Ping, but do make it quick.”

“As you wish, professor.” The bull bowed deeply, before setting his hungry sights on the likes of the former two ‘losers’. “I believe it would be *unfair* to consider their mistakes as truly *sacrilege*. I say this, as a man of faith. For our two dear peers were simply misled by the *common* misinterpretation of the facts. It is very easy to be deluded into thinking that these so-called ‘gods’ can truly have thoughts and desires, whims and wants. This is because their mimicking of the sapient mind is truly quite remarkable. And indeed at times, you wouldn’t be wrong to consider them more *sentient* than anything, akin to a common beast. In fact, a number of them *do* transcend nothingness into simple animal-like sentience.” He properly chewed the pair out, before turning to the professor with a faux-sense of compassion. “So I beg your pardon on the behalf of my fellow peers’ ignorance, professor.” The bull finally bowed, prompting Articord to simply raise a hand in acknowledgement.

“Point of courtesy noted, Lord Ping. I appreciate your *kind* gesture.” The fox responded, before turning back towards me with a renewed vigor. “Our *predecessors*, and indeed the inhabitants of many adjacent worlds once looked into the eyes of these *beasts* and assumed them to be *gods* by virtue of their power, Cadet Booker.” She paused, before gesturing towards the hologram of the ancient place of worship around us. “This ended up costing *everything*. They entrusted these *things* with blind faith, they entrusted beings and creatures of nature with the well-being of the sapient world. They willingly bound their souls, their very fates, to the whims of these *others*. They were *fools*, worshiping at the altar of self-delusion.”

There was a pause, as the professor gestured to the place of worship around us, using something akin to a wipe transition to show the place as it was at its height, and what remained of it following the apocalyptic collapse.

“The fates of each of the nine epochs were sealed the moment they made their pacts with these false gods. For even with the resistance of those who would wish for freedom from the tyranny of these ‘gods’, there were always ten more fools who would wish to consign their very being to the ‘gods’ for their own self-deluded aspirations.” The professor spoke in a way that felt *raw*, a seething hatred stirring within each and every one of her words.

“This brings me back to the *Enlightened Truth*, that the obliteration of the self from the animal and the ‘divine realm’, is necessary for the progression of civilized society. The former is necessary for self-discipline, for reasoned thought, for a *civil* society based on *sapient* rules. The latter however, is an *existential* concern. One that defines either self-determination and survival by the mortal hand, or tyranny and assured destruction by the whims of ‘gods’ that care not for the fates of a single, a hundred, a thousand, or even a million realms.” Articord once more clarified, finally circling back to her point as she eyed me down with a severe expression. “The Status Eternia in which we all enjoy, is based upon these fundamental enlightened truths. For we, as enlightened mortal rulers, protect the masses from the follies of their own short-sightedness. All of this, stemming from His Eternal Majesty’s own enlightened guidance, in bringing about this era of mortal self-determination.”

There was a pause, a lengthy one at that, following the professor’s speech.

But once again, unlike Vanavan’s, it felt like there was *substance* here.

The lore of this world, the beliefs which lay at its very core, were being unraveled layer by biased layer.

It was… difficult to discern what aspects of it were true or what were just flat-out propaganda-laden spiels however. And that was simply because of the fantastical nature of all of this.

If these ‘gods’ did exist, if there was even an inkling of truth behind what were undoubtedly layers of condensed and rehearsed propaganda, then an entire layer of complexity had just been instantly added to the greater story of the Nexus.

There were so many questions popping into my head right now.

But one above all else made its way to the surface, if only to clarify one, very important point.

“And just how exactly did ‘His Eternal Majesty’ bring about this ‘era of mortal self-determination’?” I asked, prompting the professor’s maw to curl up in an attempt at an elf-like grin.

“By taking back that which was stolen or foolishly relinquished from the mortal realm. By tearing from the hands of the realm of the ‘gods’, that which had formerly led to its destruction nine times over. By taking back the fate of the mortal world, back from the gods.” The professor paused, her eyes gleaning over the rest of the room, as if considering whether or not to bridge this answer into a classroom exercise.

A hand was raised immediately as a result.

Auris Ping’s hand.

Articord’s nod of acknowledgement came quickly.

And with it, came the bull’s blunt addition.

“By *killing* the gods.” He spoke with fiery excitement.

“Blunt, but correct, Lord Ping.”

Another exchange of nods came, and with it, Articord continued without missing a single beat.

“His Eternal Majesty, in his infinite wisdom, was a scholar amongst scholars. He saw evidence of the destruction of the past nine epochs and he determined its most obvious cause. So before the cycle could begin anew, before we returned to that path of self-assured destruction, he committed to the greatest gambit ever undertaken in known history. He decided to fight the gods… and he won. In so doing, he elevated himself into a position never before seen — a marriage of mortal sapiency, and raw godly powers. Whereas before we were at the whims of these non-sapient, at-best animal-like beings, now… we are governed by an enlightened mind. Protected by godly powers which are now at the beck and call of an enlightened being.”

“His Eternal Majesty, in effect, placed the fate of mortals back where it belongs - in the hands of the mortals.” Articord concluded with an air of reverence and satisfaction, and a twinge of what I could only describe as someone actively *recalling* a life event.

My head was practically spinning at this point.

Not a moment had passed by since ‘gods’ were revealed to me as actual entities, that their supposed ‘defeat’ at the hands of 'His Eternal Majesty' was announced so assuredly.

I didn’t know what to think at that point.

I needed time to just… process it all.

“So how did he gain all these powers?” I suddenly asked. “Politically and… practically I mean. Just by beating the gods?”

Auris smiled at that, turning to the professor as if to confirm if he was allowed to answer.

A simple nod was his response.

Which prompted him to grin all the while.

“Simple, *Cadet Emma Booker*. He did so, by *consuming* the gods.”

…

“WHAT?!”

(Author’s Note: There's certainly a lot to take in this chapter, as Articord goes deep into the story of His Eternal Majesty and begins going back and forth with the class, making sure everyone is on the same page as to who he is and what he stands for! He really is a critical fundamental piece of the Nexus, as it was, as it is, and as it continues to be! According to Articord, he was indeed the one who defeated the gods and brought the fate of mortalkind back into the hands of the mortals! How true that story is, or how far things have changed since then, remains to be seen! Two things are for certain though, His Eternal Majesty really is the key player in this greater game, and Auris Ping really has managed to regain his footing in the points game as well! I'm really excited to get into more of his eternal lore as we unpack more about him as the story continues! I hope you guys enjoy! :D **The next Two Chapters are already up on Patreon if you guys are interested in getting early access to future chapters!**)

2020-07-01 09:26:26,"[Spoilers] Your handy-dandy guide to the most common questions after finishing Dark season 3 Hi all, come on in! But also stay out until I observe you doing one or the other and force you into a definitive state.

Just finished Season 3 of Dark? Congratulations on finishing what is arguably the most complex television gauntlet ever crafted! Let's all agree that Dark is one of the most confusing shows of all time, *perhaps* even to a fault. While the show gives you plenty of answers up front, it also holds back quite a few of them that are waiting to be found amongst the dirty details where the devil is said to be chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all cool. 

If you're like me, you binged the entire season in a day, and were left reeling from all the various philosophical and quantum mechanical ideas the show packs in to 8 measly hours. I thought I had a decent understanding of what they had shown me, but I also knew I was missing pieces. Some aspects of the ending felt absolutely contradictory, and I just couldn't understand why a show that had been so meticulously crafted would all of a sudden leave an ending that didn't feel airtight in its own logic. Sounding familiar?

After three straight days of reading and consulting with the lovely folks on this subreddit, I'm thrilled to say we've (hopefully) put together a comprehensive understanding and consensus of the intended interpretation of the ending. Speaking of which, that's a funny thing to say because the ending is certainly ambiguous enough in several regards to interpret in other ways. I think Papa Bo and Mama Jantje deliberately left enough room for multiple arguments to be made, so that's not to say that this guide is infallible. It's just the best we've got so far, and I hope everyone in the comments continues to offer improvements!

One other note: this thread mostly exists to directly address questions and answers about the show's fictional narrative. For a much deeper and more comprehensive literary analysis of the show's themes, check out [this amazing write-up](https://www.reddit.com/r/DarK/comments/hk6e1l/spoilers_s3_dark_is_not_about_time_travel/) courtesy of u/8R8A8. 

Without further ado, let's get in to the most frequently asked questions about the ending of Dark!

**How was Claudia able to change things? Didn't the ending break its own rules? Isn't it a paradox that Jonas and alt-Martha disappear at the end if their existence is required to save the Tannhaus family in the first place?**

Bear with me here, because this one is a doozy. Dark started out as a show about impossible contradictions. The ""bootstrap paradox"" that we've come to know and love has shaped nearly every single aspect of our story. Every character who can trace their origin back to Jonas and alt-Martha's Unknown child (commonly referred to as The Origin in the show and the Cleft Lip Trio or CLT on this subreddit) owes their existence to this paradox. It can exist in Adam and Eva's world because the show taught us early on that here, time is nonlinear. An item affected by time travel has mutual dependence on both its past and future, because every moment coexists simultaneously. There is no discernible beginning nor end. The show slowly gets us more and more comfortable with that idea before unveiling the ultimate bootstrap paradox: two women who are each other's mothers. By now, we are so familiar with this logic that we are ready to accept this possibility because it is logically sound within the show's scope.

Season 3 attempts to do this for us one more time on an even more complex scale. In the later half of season 3, we learn about the possibility of overlapping parallel realities that are the result of quantum mechanics at work. Dark forces us to accept something that to our brains is bizarrely impossible: during the apocalypse in Adam's world, Jonas is saved by alt-Martha **AND** not saved by alt-Martha. At this point in the story, we are given an in-universe explanation for why this is possible: Adam's loophole that he has searched for does in fact exist, and Eva found it. It is the moment when time stops during the apocalypse and the chain of cause-and-effect is broken. 

Eva uses this moment to create the parallel realities by either sending alt-Bartosz to stop alt-Martha from saving Jonas at this perfect moment, or allowing alt-Martha to save Jonas. In the reality in which he is saved, Jonas is shot and killed by the Eva Gang and alt-Martha is given a deadly apocalyptic abortion courtesy of Adam. In the reality in which Jonas is NOT saved, both characters live and go on to become Adam and Eva. **Both of these things happen.** Eva describes these events from her point of view as a series of alternations—the ""first"" time she sends alt-Bartosz to stop alt-Martha, the ""next"" time she allows alt-Martha to save Jonas. This can feel confusing, because of course in these knotted worlds there is no such thing as ""first this, then that."" Eva clarifies that the two worlds act as a more complex mobius strip—one line infinitely feeding into itself. Therefore, the consequences of both of these realities are present in both worlds at the same time. Eva has **always** done both these things, and each reality is mutually dependent upon the other to exist. In this way we can think of it as an even more complex version of the bootstrap paradox.

Before the story continues much further, we are then introduced to the concept of Schrodinger's Cat through some quaint Winden public access television. This further explains the ideas of superposed states as we understand them in real-life quantum mechanics. It is at this point we need to realize that this concept does not exist solely to serve the story purpose of Jonas and alt-Martha both dying **AND** not dying. That was just our introduction to it, similar to how we had to accept that Michael Kahnwald was Mikkel Nielsen before we could accept that Elizabeth was her own grandmother.

Continuing on, the loop's answer porn begins. The seventh episode gives us a taste of the missing bits in nearly every character's journey through the loop. The concept of determinism from the earlier seasons starts to get hammered home again. Even when we get to Claudia's final conversation with Adam, she continues to stress that she is also a slave to cause-and-effect. All three main players—Adam, Eva, and Claudia—have done nothing but keep the loop intact for an eternity, each for their own reasons: Adam believes he destroys the knot by killing The Origin at the end of his journey, but he's wrong; Eva wants to perpetually rebirth their son and has been manipulating Adam all along to accomplish this; and Claudia has been working to get to this moment so that she can finally take advantage of everything she has learned in the last 33 years and use Eva's loophole for herself. 

By taking advantage of the moment when time stops, Claudia creates her own parallel reality. She has a conversation with Adam and says that it is happening for the first time, and we can't really blame her for thinking so, because from her perspective, that's true. But remember, this conversation with Adam is both happening **AND** not happening. In her ""new"" reality, she enlightens Adam on how Jonas and alt-Martha can finally untie the knot. But in her other reality, she never has this conversation at all. We don't get to see the end of this other reality, but Eva tells us that Adam kills her and her body is found by her younger self. From here we can presume the rest of the events of the loop take their course and loop on as usual. What we *do* see, however, is Claudia's new parallel reality play out. Adam teaches Jonas about the loophole, Jonas saves alt-Martha, and they travel to the origin world. Just like when alt-Martha saved Jonas **AND** didn't save Jonas, Claudia had her conversation with Adam **AND** didn't have her conversation with Adam. Once again, **both of these things happen, and from a perspective of nonlinear time, have always happened.** There is now a reality where the loop cycles on as usual, **AND** there is a reality where the loop leads to an exit point for Jonas and alt-Martha's journey to the origin world, and both of these realities exist simultaneously. With me so far?

So why did we learn about Schrodinger's Cat? Remember how our poor quantum kitty was both dead **AND** alive at the same time? It is not in just one state or the other until it is observed and forced into a final state definitively. If Schrodinger's box had a cat in it that was both dead **AND** alive at the same time, then Tannhaus' box has a knot in it that is both tied **AND** untied at the same time. We can think of the entire knot as a superposition of quantum states that have yet to be observed by an outsider. Jonas and Martha represent immeasurable particles whose exact position and direction are undefinable. The knot is both tied and untied until it can be observed and forced into one final state definitively.

When the original HG Tannhaus destroyed his world with his seemingly botched time machine, he created two worlds where nonlinear deterministic time travel existed. Instantaneously, the entire infinite knot of these two worlds was created in their bootstrapped complexity—every moment existing in tandem with every other moment, allowing for an endlessly complex web of mutually dependent people, objects, and events. As we've established, this knot both infinitely recurs into itself **AND** leads to an exit point in the origin world simultaneously in two realities superposed on top of one another thanks to Claudia's quantum fuckery. That exit is the moment of the exact event Tannhaus was trying to alter in the first place.

From the perspective of the origin world, Tannhaus' invention of time travel has created two superposed states. In one, his family remains dead and the knot exists eternally. In the other, his family lives because of Jonas and alt-Martha's actions at the knot's exit point and time travel is never created at all. Until otherwise observed, **both of these things happen.** ""But wait!"" we all rush to say, ""that is a grandfather paradox! How can Jonas and alt-Martha prevent Tannhaus from creating time travel if it has to exist for them to be created in the first place?"" The answer is that in the origin world, time travel does not exist (with one exception), and therefore, **time is linear.** It is only in the knot's reality that time is nonlinear, and mutually dependent bootstrap paradoxes can exist. Consequently, once the Tannhaus family's rescue is observed, all the other possible realities and worlds collapse back into this one definitively determined state. The quantum reality wherein the Tannhaus family dies and our knot gets created is finally, permanently destroyed, and will never recur again. Jonas and alt-Martha are essentially quantum time travelers. They come from a reality that both existed infinitely **AND** allowed them to escape, forcing its eternal torment to finally cease. Tannhaus successfully created one glorious instance of time travel in his origin world, and never knows about it. All it took was an eternity of pain and suffering across two worlds and multiple parallel realities to get it done.

This is all quite nicely illustrated by u/bhhari91 [here](https://i.redd.it/ax9248rqgo751.jpg).

If you think about it, how do you end a story about determinism? It either ends with more determinism (boring, predictable, nihilistic) or it breaks its own rules (contradictory, frustrating, unfulfilling). To paraphrase from u/ChompCity, we’re dealing with infinite time loops in a show that has already gone out of its way to hammer home predetermination and the lack of free will. We get hints that even Claudia “breaking the loop” is part of the loop. Any explanation that only uses time loops falls prey to one time paradox or another when we see everything disappear. How do you break an infinite loop? How do you overcome no free will? How do Jonas and alt-Martha save the Tannhaus family if they never existed? Only the superposition explanation can handle that paradox logically. There are several puzzle pieces that support it, and it’s an awesome, thought-provoking ending to an awesome, thought-provoking series.

I also love the detail that despite everything the show has told us, our instinct is still to think of things in dualities. Either Claudia broke out of her deterministic cycle, or she didn't. Either the knot is tied, or it is untied. But nothing is complete without a third dimension. Neither ever, nor never.

**So what does the ending mean?**

In the end, Jonas and alt-Martha have permanently erased themselves along with their entire knot at the cost of fixing the origin world's course. The only people who live in the origin world are those who were never of the knot in the first place. Anyone who can trace their lineage back to Jonas and alt-Martha through Unknown/The Origin/CLT never existed in the origin world at all. There are also significant changes due to actions certain knotted characters are no longer able to take, and of course the unending ripples of those non-actions. 

Most of the Winden crew who do still exist are at that dinner party in the final scene. Claudia and Bernd still exist, they are still Regina's parents (oh right, Bernd is Regina's father by the way) and they presumably got married in this world (still creepy). Aleksander/Boris would still exist, but he's not here because this world doesn't have the Nielsen family (the entire Nielsen name and family is a bootstrap paradox!), which means the incident that caused Aleksander and Regina to meet (the bullying scene) would have never happened (thank you u/KissMyBlade). There is also no Winden power plant because Unknown was never able to strong-arm the mayor of Winden into signing the papers, which is an important detail because it's possibly the reason Regina no longer has cancer. Other people who would still exist but are not present due to either being dead or just not being cool enough would be: Egon, Doris, Jana, Helge, Tannhaus, and Ines.

During the party there is a power outage that hilariously interrupts Wöller's story about his eye. During this power outage, Hannah experiences déjà vu. She remembers last night in her dream she experienced this exact moment, except it was the end of the world. Everything ended. It was dark and never became light again. She had a peculiar feeling that it was a **good** thing that everything had ended, for it all to be over. That she was suddenly free of everything; no wanting, no having to, just infinite darkness. No yesterday. No today. No tomorrow. Nothing.

This is our final confirmation that Jonas and alt-Martha's worlds have well and truly ended. All of our beloved characters who no longer exist are finally at peace, and free of the infinite sickness of their cycle. It is horribly sad, but also bittersweet; they are gone, but finally liberated from their unending torment. We then learn that Hannah and Wöller are pregnant, and Hannah gets the idea to name the baby Jonas. Let's remember that for the next question!

**What was the deal with the *Interstellar* Tunnel Of Light scene?**

This scene is brought up a lot as evidence for why Jonas and alt-Martha still exist and are still stuck in their loop. They see each other in the Tunnel Of Light and alt-Martha (and presumably Jonas as well) recalls that moment from earlier in her life. So doesn't that mean that their journey to the Tunnel Of Light has happened before, and will always happen as part of their loop?

Well, maybe. In one sense, you could argue that it has happened before because their path to the origin world is a superposed parallel reality that is indeed part of the everlasting loop. But I think there is a better and more interesting explanation. The Tunnel Of Light is in between realities, and exists outside of time and space. When Jonas and alt-Martha see each other, they are forming an extremely important connection. It is the seed for the déjà vu they will experience that inevitably draws them to each other. And because this seed is being planted outside of time and space, it is perhaps planted in every single possible reality, whether that's just the ones we know about, or even more.

Now let's go back to the ending of the show. Hannah wants to name her son Jonas, so some brand new form of our Jonas may yet be born into the origin world after all. Supposing that means a brand new form of Martha might also be born into the origin world, it's a nice thought that their seed of déjà vu planted in all realities might still bring them together <3

**Why did it have to be Jonas and alt-Martha who saved the Tannhaus family? Couldn't Claudia just have done it herself?**

The mostly widely accepted explanation at this point seems to be twofold: firstly, Jonas and alt-Martha needed to plant their timeless seed of déjà vu in the Tunnel Of Light, which plays an important role in their loops in the realities of their worlds. Decent answer. But the more interesting answer requires some conjecture, and a bit of spirituality. There is a lot of symbolism going on, and folks are still puzzling it all out, but there's some pretty compelling evidence for the following answer. 

Tannhaus accidentally split his reality in two when he created time travel, and inadvertently became the Creator (God?) of two brand new worlds. His desire to save his son, daughter-in-law, and granddaughter became the driving force behind both worlds he had created. Almost every critical part of the loop in these worlds can be traced back to someone losing and trying to save their child: Claudia wanted to save Regina, Eva kept the cycles repeating to ensure her son's existence, Ulrich and Katharina sacrificed their lives trying to save Mikkel, Noah wanted to bring Charlotte back to Elisabeth, Michael killed himself so that Jonas could continue to live, etc. Similarly, something like the ""souls"" of Marek, Sonja, and Baby Charlotte were reborn into alt-Martha, Jonas, and their Unknown baby that would tie both worlds together. Their presence in the origin world and ensuing non-existence are essentially a sacrifice of their own lives for the Tannhaus family's lives, and a transference of their souls back to their original forms. This is of course just a theory, but there's decent literary evidence for this:

MARek TAnnhaus = MARTA. The genders have swapped but Marek and Martha are both the more emotional of the two, with lots of repressed anger regarding their families. I realize that Marta and Martha aren't spelled the same (although they are two versions of the same name, etymologically), but if it makes more sense to you this way, it could also be thought of as MARek TannHAus = MARTHA.

SONJA is an anagram for JONAS. They are the more quiet, reserved, and loving of the two.

If you rewatch the meeting of these four characters, you can almost see that they seem to recognize each other. Proponents of this theory would say they are essentially the same souls, so to speak, and we are witnessing the transference of those souls back to their original forms so that they can live on in the fixed origin world. Interesting!!

**How does Claudia learn about the Origin World? How does she know Regina survives in it?**

We have already established that Claudia has been stuck in the loop just like everyone else for all of eternity. Contrary to many of the other popular theories out there, Claudia *does not* experience any changes along her path in the loop, even though from her perspective, she feels like she does when she creates the reality that allows her to have her conversation with Adam. This means that everything Claudia learns during her 33 year journey, she has always learned. She always learns from her older self, kills alt-Claudia, infiltrates Eva's world, learns about Eva's loophole, and yes, she always finds out about the Origin World, and always figures out how the knot can be untied. It is not made 100% clear how Claudia learns about the Origin World, but she tells us enough and we can fill in the gaps from some information around the edges. 

Claudia's first big revelation upon studying both worlds' family trees was that not everyone was part of the knot. Only those whose lineage could be traced back to Unknown/The Origin/CLT were of the knot, and to her that meant there must be a world where this knot didn't exist at all that gave birth to the knotted worlds. Maybe a bit of a logical leap for us, but let's give Claudia the benefit of the doubt in that she is a brilliant scientist and scholar. As for how she figured out what caused the birth of these worlds, remember that Tannhaus' family dies in Adam and Eva's worlds too. I think it wouldn't have been too hard for Claudia to deduce that this scientist whose family is fairly famous in Winden for their obsession with time travel was the culprit all along. What's more, I think it was crucially important that Charlotte Doppler was placed in his care after he lost his family to quench his otherwise unquenchable desire to create time travel after experiencing their loss. Without Charlotte to raise and care for, he would have gone down the same path as he did in his first origin world timeline and possibly **split the worlds once again!** Thank goodness that didn't happen, this show is complex enough as is...

There are also some interesting elements around the edges of the story that might come in to play here. The first would be the ever-present character of Ariadne. In Greek mythology, Ariadne is a princess associated with mazes and labyrinths because of her involvement in the myths of the Minotaur and Theseus. She has shown up around the edges of Dark since season 1 by being the subject of the fictional play put on by Winden's high school in both worlds. In classical logic, ""Ariadne's Thread"" is a method of problem-solving defined thusly (the following is almost entirely copy-pasted from wikipedia):

> Ariadne's thread, named for the legend of Ariadne, is solving a problem by multiple means—such as a physical maze, a logic puzzle, or an ethical dilemma—through an exhaustive application of logic to all available routes. The key element to applying Ariadne's thread to a problem is the creation and maintenance of a record—physical or otherwise—of the problem's available and exhausted options at all times. This record is referred to as the ""thread"", regardless of its actual medium. The purpose the record serves is to permit backtracking—that is, reversing earlier decisions and trying alternatives. Given the record, applying the algorithm is straightforward: at any moment that there is a choice to be made, make one arbitrarily from those not already marked as failures, and follow it logically as far as possible. If a contradiction results, back up to the last decision made, mark it as a failure, and try another decision at the same point. If no other options exist there, back up to the last place in the record that does, mark the failure at that level, and proceed onward. This algorithm will terminate upon either finding a solution or marking all initial choices as failures; in the latter case, there is no solution. If a thorough examination is desired even though a solution has been found, one can revert to the previous decision, mark the success, and continue on as if a solution were never found; the algorithm will exhaust all decisions and find all solutions.

This could be an explanation of Claudia's process over the 33 years she spends in both worlds. She is eventually able to figure out every important detail pertaining to the origin world through her tireless scientific process and disciplined mind. She accomplishes something we might find highly improbable, but this isn't the first time we've seen this kind of determination. In episode 7 of season 3, HG Tannhaus has a voiceover where he says the following:

> ""Fate is playing a cruel game with us. Yet we will always believe there is a way to turn the tide in our favor. If only we want it bad enough. A person is able to pursue a goal, **no matter how unattainable it may seem**, over the course of an entire lifetime. No resistance, no obstacle is great enough to stop one from pursuing one's will.""

In other words, Tannhaus' seemingly impossible invention of time travel in the origin world is a parallel to Claudia's seemingly impossible ability to learn about the Origin World and its creation of their worlds.

**What turns The Stranger into Adam? Why did Stranger-Adam kill Hannah?**

The Stranger's transformation into Adam hinges on alt-Martha's letter. That letter convinced him that killing Martha was crucial in order to actually save Martha. All of a sudden, we understand that Adam's seemingly heartless act of murder was simply still motivated by that one desire to save her life that he has carried with him his entire life.

In this way, we also understand that Adam is now prepared to do absolutely anything to achieve this goal. He believes that his sins will ultimately be erased by achieving his eventual purpose of destroying the Origin. It could be argued that his murder of Hannah is primarily a thing of practicality; he knows that Silja is not where she needs to be to fulfill her loop, and he also knows that the only way to take her is over Hannah's dead body (literally). But even with that said, he would also have personal reasons to hate her too: he has spent his entire life questioning if she ever really loved his father. Even worse, she stole his time machine to essentially go torture the man she ostensibly loved in place of his father.

**Where did Stranger-Adam get his scars/disfigurement?**

I see a lot of people asking about this. There is understandable confusion because not just once, but TWICE, we are told that Adam's appearance is a result of traveling. It's important to understand that this explanation is nothing more than an overly-flowery metaphor. The real answer is shown when The Stranger gets his arm zapped by his time-machine-in-progress. The implication is that this is the first of many, many injuries The Stranger sustains during the process of constructing his time machine. Remember, The Stranger has the confidence of a man who knows he is currently immortal. He has no fear of subjecting himself to the insanely dangerous conditions of working on his machine, and consequently it steadily fucks his day up for years on end, resulting in his eventual ghoulish appearance we've come to know and love.

**What was the significance of alt-Egon showing up right after alt-Hannah's miscarriage? How is there even an alt-Silja and therefore an alt-Agnes and therefore the entire family tree in Eva's world?**

Alt-Egon's mission from Eva was to ""preserve the family tree."" He arrives after alt-Hannah's miscarriage to take her to the '50s, where she can meet the younger alt-Egon, and they can get down to business to create alt-Silja together (and therefore, the entire alt-family tree).

**Why did alt-Martha's scars keep changing sides? Same with Unknown/The Origin/CLT? Same with Claudia's eye colors?**

Everyone's facial symmetry is flipped depending on which world they are in at the time. In fact, most of the alt-world is mirrored right down to the landscape and the buildings!

**FOUR alt-Marthas??? How were there so many alt-Marthas???**

The four alt-Marthas that were present at the death of Jonas-Who-Was-Saved-By-Martha were:

1. Yellow-Jacket-Martha, who is earliest in her timeline of the four. She is newly pregnant with The Origin, but has yet to reach the point of branching realities which occurs during the apocalypse in Adam's world.

2. Martha-Who-Did-Not-Save-Jonas who is just a bit further along her timeline than Yellow-Jacket-Martha. She has just received her scar and been convinced that killing Jonas is in all of their best interests. She will grow into the other two Marthas who are here.

3. Stranger Martha, an older version of Martha-Who-Did-Not-Save-Jonas.

4. Eva, an even older version of Martha-Who-Did-Not-Save-Jonas and Stranger Martha.

**What happened to Clausen? Who wrote him that letter? How about the rest of Aleksander's past?**

I, too, spent much of the off-season thinking about these two. I was so sure that there was more to come here. But when you think about it, now that we know where the story went, what else is there to answer about these two besides the one answer they gave us in season 3? Both of them were exactly what they seemed to be at the end of season 2. Boris accidentally murdered the real Aleksander Kohler. He got rid of the body and assumed the man's identity, hiding the rest of the evidence by taking Regina's last name. Clausen is the brother of the real Aleksander Kohler, and was sent to Winden on a tip that his brother's killer was there. Who tipped off Clausen by writing him that letter? It was Unknown/The Origin/CLT. Before murdering the old Tannhaus, Unknown directly quotes from the letter that was written to Clausen. It was important that Clausen investigate Winden in Adam's world because he is an instrumental part of causing the apocalypse there. Speaking of Unknown and the apocalypse...

**What is the point of everything Unknown/The Origin/CLT does?**

In addition to being the central figure of the knot's family tree in both worlds, most of Unknown's actions serve one goal: cause the apocalypse in both worlds. They kill Bernd to take his master key for the nuclear power plant. They break into the power plant and kill Claudia's secretary while obtaining the diagram of the volume control system. They kill old Tannhaus to stop him from spreading the word about time travelers. They strong-arm the mayor of Winden into signing the plant's permit. And finally they cause the starting conditions for both apocalypses by opening a valve in the plants' volume control rooms, which creates the nuclear waste and the god particle. Oh, and one other cool tidbit in case you missed it: Unknown is the author of the leather triquetra journal!

**What was the significance of Noah and Bartosz's tattoos?**

Their tattoos are copies of the real-life Emerald Tablet. From the Dark Wiki:

> The Emerald Tablet, also known as the Smaragdine Table, or Tabula Smaragdina, is a piece of the Hermetica (Egyptian-Greek wisdom texts from the 2nd century AD), reputed to contain the secret of the prima materia – the essence of all matter. It was regarded by European alchemists as the foundation of their art. The line ""Sic Mundus Creatus Est,"" which is written on the door to the wormhole, is derived from the text.

Hermeticism is very complex, but to briefly summarize, the tradition traces its origin to a *prisca theologia*—a doctrine that affirms the existence of a single, true theology that is present in all religions, and that was given by God to man in antiquity. Essentially we can think of Noah and Bartosz as priests of the Sic Mundus religion, and the triquetra journal is their bible.

**How did Magnus and Franziska have a time travel sphere?**

This is a bootstrapped sphere! It is the very same one that alt-Martha is carrying with her when Magnus and Franziska show up to take her with them.

**OK those are the biggest questions that I feel there are definite answers for. The following questions don't have clearer answers, and as the viewer, we are left to fill in the blanks ourselves.**

**How did Adam know about The Origin? How did he know about Eva's world? Why *didn't* he know about the second parallel reality alt-Martha that is still pregnant after he kills the first parallel reality alt-Martha considering he has no memory of sleeping with alt-Martha?**

Adam would have learned about The Origin from Claudia's final pages that Noah retrieved for him, and would have passed that information on to his younger self. It's tough to pinpoint exactly when Adam informed himself of this, but clearly early enough that killing it has been part of his plan for a long time. He learned of Eva's world when he met alt-Martha in 1888. He's obviously very wary of her at first, but again, with enough knowledge from the leather triquetra journal, it was likely easy to figure out who exactly she was. The piece of information that was **deliberately** left out of the journal would have been Eva's loophole trick. Remember, it's Unknown who writes the journal, so he writes exactly what Eva wants him to write in order to deceive Adam. It's likely that details of the parallel Jonas were in there so he would understand why alt-Martha was pregnant, but any detail about a parallel alt-Martha was left out. Why didn't Adam figure it out for himself? Because Adam is an idiot. That's a consistent detail throughout the loop.

**What were the bunker's time machines for? Why was Noah killing all those kids?**

The bunker time machines were the earliest iterations (technologically speaking) of time travel technology in the show. In the Sic Mundus lair in season 2, Adam briefly mentions that the time travel technology has had to go through many iterations that started with the bunker machines. At first the machine was successful in sending someone through time, except they were dead when they arrived which was a bit of a bummer. Their eyes were also burned away by the machine's eye-level metal ring, which was apparently poor design, because when the machine finally works it has a full-body metal ring instead of just around the eyes. Presumably, this technology eventually evolved into the portable time machine which could take you 33 years in either direction, and then into the Sic Mundus machine which could take you to any year, and then eventually into the time travel sphere which could take you not only across time, but also space (including other worlds).

**Why do the primordial Sic Mundus crew from the end of season 2 travel all the way to 1888? Shouldn't their machine only take them 33 years in a given direction?**

Again, it's not made totally clear, but I think there's a solid answer here. During the apocalypse, the loophole moment wherein time stops for a nanosecond has dire repercussions on the world (we learn this from a radio broadcast in season 3). All of the world's machines were affected in a significant way, with the main example being planes falling out of the sky. Considering this crew traveled during the apocalypse, it could be that their portable time machine was briefly on the fritz, and that's what took them 132 years (33 times 4) back in time. It could also explain why they were out of fuel upon arrival—the machine used all the available cesium to make such a big jump.

**How did Hannah and Silja seem to ignore the 33-year rule of their machine as well?**

Hannah said that Eva approached her and told her that Jonas was looking for her. Presumably Eva used a time travel sphere to send Hannah and Silja exactly where they needed to be.

**Where did Noah get the portable time machine that he gives to Bartosz?**

This question as well as the entire timeline of the portable time machine is addressed in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRM2KjU_OjQ&feature=youtu.be).

**Why was Ines drugging Michael/Mikkel?**

This was to show us how deeply affected Mikkel was by the horrendous incident that defined his life. He likely suffered from constant nightmares and PTSD for his entire life. Poor Mikkel...

**Why were the time travel spheres from Eva's world so much more advanced than Adam's?**

Again, I wish we saw a clear answer for this. How about one alt-Tannhaus scene where he talks about how the cesium isotope in Eva's world is much more potent compared to the one from Adam's world? Something like that would have been nice. The only correlated piece of evidence for this is the fact that the alt-apocalypse is much stronger than the one in Adam's world. We see Eva's world's future, and it is even more barren and desolate than Adam's post-apocalypse. So perhaps from that, we can say something about the radioactive material in their world allowed for much more advanced time travel. Just spitballin'.

A nice theory suggested by u/sanddragon939 (paraphrased): 

> The apple time machines are likely the only machines built using contemporary 21st century technology. Adam's time machine in his world was built using 19th and very early 20th century technology. The Tannhaus device was built using 1950's technology. The chair 1980's technology. The dark matter time machine in the power plant was built using 21st century technology, albeit after the apocalypse.

**Where was Agnes sent to and why didn't they show us?**

I think the implication here is that Agnes was sent to fulfill her role in the family tree. In other words, she was sent to go have the creepiest sex imaginable with the middle-aged Unknown while his child-self and old-self watched from the shadows. I mean, they probably didn't actually watch, but who knows, that guy is creepy as fuck. I think this event is icky enough that Papa Bo and Mama Jantje decided it was more tasteful to NOT show us what could be perceived as deterministic rape.

**What was the point of the cesium-covered apparitions of Michael (S01E01) and alt-Martha (S03E01)?**

This is my least favorite aspect of the show to be honest. There's a fairly good answer for Michael's apparition. At the end of season 1 we see that The Stranger has a hallucination of cesium-covered Michael just like Jonas did. This is meant to show us that Michael's death haunts Jonas for the rest of his life as he continues having visions of his dead father due to severe PTSD.

I wish there was a solid answer for alt-Martha's vision. Maybe someone out there knows. Based on the outfit the cesium-covered Martha is wearing, it appears to be the Martha from Adam's world during the night of the party when she and Jonas first slept together. Why would alt-Martha have a vision of her counterpart from Adam's world? I don't know. I think it's just to make the parallel to Jonas' vision in season one. I really wish they had just left this out instead of calling even more attention to it.

**Why does Jonas blindly trust the last piece of information given to him no matter what?**

Because our poor, sweet, beautiful Jonas is an idiot. Let's face it, the dude dropped out of high school and spent his entire life not knowing which was was up or down. He spent ~30 years with Claudia creating time travel after the apocalypse, except clearly she was doing all the heavy lifting because it took him another ~30 years to do it again when he was on his own in the 1800's. I love the guy, but he's not the darkest matter in Schrödinger’s box, if you know what I mean.

**Why is the series called Dark?**

Dark deeds done in a darkly depicted tone to Winden denizens in the dark by determined dark doers for the duel between dark and light deciding the destiny of the dark matter and the infinite dark in which our knotted characters dwell. Take your pick!

**Who in the world would have had sex with Helge??**

The greatest mystery in all of Dark. My guess? Bernd took him to a hooker when things got pathetic enough. And given all of Winden's apparent distaste for any kind of contraceptive, she immediately got pregnant and didn't tell anyone until right before she died and had Peter sent to Winden to be with his father.

**Why did alt-Magnus cover alt-Franziska's mouth while they were having sex if she can't speak?**

Ever had sex with a deaf girl? Yeah, me neither. Ever watched porn with a deaf girl? They're loud AF.

About half of the student body was blinded by the sudden and intense flash of light that blanketed the room.

The other half seemed to have reacted in time to shield themselves from that unexpected assault on the senses.

I was part of that latter half.

And what I saw during those precious few seconds of visual overstimulation was nothing short of remarkable.

The walls that had resembled Mal’tory’s dark and dreary office quaked and quivered in place, as if the whole room was a living organism, and we were somehow nestled within its guts.

Each of the ornate wooden panels began dislodging from one another, their formerly flush surfaces cracking, revealing seams where there had been none before. These seams too began expanding, as each of the panels started wobbling, wiggling, then eventually disconnecting from one another entirely; moving independently of one another as if freeing themselves from a long-dormant state.

For a moment, they looked almost like a reptile’s scales when put under magnification.

Then, and without any warning, they began *disappearing*, each panel violently pulled back and into some dark anomalous void that existed *behind* the walls themselves; sending the EVI into another fit of spatial error reports.

We were, for a split second, completely wall-less. But not a second after the old walls had been… for lack of a better term — banished to the literal shadow realm, did a set of new walls suddenly take their place.

And quite dramatically too.

As an entirely new wallface suddenly emerged darkness of the void, one that was earthy in tones, and reminded me more of those old teakwood heritage buildings back on Earth. There were fewer embellishments to them compared to the previous Victorian-styled walls, less patterns and ostentatious designs, instead simply going with this *less is more* approach that left vast empty gaps where decorations and patterns were previously present. It was almost as if they were left empty and bare for a reason.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 475% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

Out of nowhere, dozens of pots, planters, and trellises suddenly embedded themselves *through* the wall, decorating what was no longer a blank canvas.

Plantlife soon followed this open invitation for a free home, as hundreds of flowers bloomed all across the wall, carefully trimmed and perfectly appointed to the lattice structures they coiled on, with not a single one of them looking too wild or out of place.

The sudden and abrupt remodeling completely threw me off.

At least, until the source of it all suddenly made themselves known.

“Welcome, first years, to Mana-field perception and Light Magic theory.” The voice continued, as through the literal haze of change came a female figure that the EVI had little problem assigning a name and identifier to.

**ENTITY IFF CONFIRMED: A109 Apprentice Larial Essen - NEXUS \[CORDIAL\]**

Yet strangely, the metallic footsteps that I’d heard just before she crossed the staff door’s threshold didn’t seem to follow her. Instead, only the apprentice emerged from the door behind the lectern.

She continued towards the lectern with a forced and somewhat stiff poise and gait, her general demeanor identical to how she carried herself prior to the whole crate saga. Which was of course, stern, tired, and completely unyielding; a fact supported by the impeccable posture she used to walk into class.

Though the class’ focus certainly wasn’t on her demeanor, or her posture, nor even on the room that had completely morphed into a completely different space.

No.

It was instead almost squarely focused on the apprentice’s cloak, which was most certainly *not* black.

This prompted the entire room to erupt into a *frenzy* of whispers, tempered only by those daring enough to deploy privacy screens.

But before those antics could evolve any further, and before my mind could even catch up with this turn of events, a loud, high-pitched, and unbroken — *SHUSH* — erupted from the front of the class. Emerging from a certain gorn-like lizard, who’d stood up to face *us* rather than the apprentice currently manning her podium. “ALL STUDENTS RISE!” He commanded.

To which the entire class followed, with the only two tentative parties being myself and a certain bull.

“ALL STUDENTS FORWARD AND BOW!” He continued, prompting the whole class to follow suit, and from there, receiving a head-tilt’s worth of praise from the apprentice.

“Thank you, Lord Qiv.” The apprentice spoke appreciatively, before setting her sights on the rest of the desks and chairs—

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 200% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

—which were subsequently transformed into brighter-toned variants of their formerly dark and depressive selves. “I understand that there may be quite a few lingering questions amongst the crowd that quite a few of you wish to be addressed. In the spirit of ensuring that these needless thoughts and senseless rumors do not come to cloud your mind throughout the rest of class, thereby rendering these lessons moot, I wish for them to be addressed here and now.” Larial announced tacitly, but with a severity that was clearly modeled off of her mentor.

The mood of the room quickly changed following that.

But instead of shifting to the deference and submission in Articord’s class, or the tentative acceptance of Vanavan’s class, there was instead an overarching tone of outright confusion.

It was as if the whole class didn’t know how best to handle the situation.

But whilst the rest of the room remained undecided, with a few shaky hands rising up one by one, a sense of relief quickly washed over me as my emotions finally managed to catch up to the rapidly developing turn of events.

I couldn’t help but to immediately activate the in-armor positional readjustment mode in the suit, allowing myself to just… slouch; as I took in the class with a renewed wave of reprieve.

It was that same feeling you get when you arrive on the day of the test, only to find it delayed by a week. Or that feeling you get when a notification arrives in the dead of night, on the eve of a presentation, to inexplicably announce that the whole project was now put on hold due to some unforeseen event.

But unlike those situations where the *why* of the situation didn’t really matter… here, it most certainly *did*.

Which prompted me to listen in, as the questions began flying towards the apprentice.

“If I may be the one so brazen as to offer myself as the voice of the year group, Apprentice Essen?” A certain Auris Ping took the lead, having been chosen by the apprentice amidst a sea of equally inquisitive hands.

“The floor is yours, Lord Ping.” The apprentice proclaimed.

“Thank you, Apprentice.” The bull responded curtly, eliciting a particularly intense glare from the likes of Thalmin. “Where is Professor Mal’tory?”

The apprentice’s features shifted somewhat at that question, as if she wasn’t expecting something that blunt and straightforward right out of the gate. “The professor’s whereabouts are the business of the Academy’s faculty and staff.” She spoke firmly, yet with an authority that she was clearly under equipped to wield. “If you wish to inquire as to the nature of this class going forward, I will be more than happy to-”

A series of hands were raised even *before* the apprentice had even finished her sentence. Which prompted the overworked and exhausted elf to switch over to another student before she even had time to finish her own thoughts. “The floor is yours, Lady Ladona.”

“Thank you, Apprentice. Now, to clarify, are we to expect *you* to be teaching *us* for the rest of this class?” The being, which I could only describe as a butterfly with most of their insectoid-traits toned down, asked politely.

“That is correct, Lady Ladona.”

“And is this expected to continue for… the rest of the month?” Ladona continued, her features shifting if only to show her growing sense of confidence.“The semester perhaps? Or maybe even the rest of the school year?” She continued at a rapid-fire pace, making a point to catch the apprentice off-guard before she could even respond to that first point.

“The responsibility of tutelage has been deferred to me on the basis of Professor Mal’tory’s current inability to fulfill this particular aspect of his responsibilities owing to his current engagements. This will remain so, until the Professor returns from said engagements.” The apprentice responded in that same jaded, no-nonsense tone of voice she’d used during our pre-life debt interactions.

It was, however, woefully inadequate in dealing with the likes of a vicious social predator like Ladona, who immediately waded through the tepid waters towards the first sign of weakness. “So when can we expect his return, Apprentice?” She pushed further, her polite tone of voice acting like a velvet cloth, barely concealing the sharp mandibles beneath it.

“That is something I cannot answer.” The apprentice replied sternly, taking a stand against the  shark that had now tasted blood in the water.

“Is this because of a lack of correspondence to the faculty?” The butterfly-person shot back quickly with an innocent cock of her head, her antennae swaying as she did so.

“I am not at a privilege to divulge such details, and that is most certainly *not* the case, Lady Ladona.”

“My apologies, Apprentice.” Ladona spoke in a calculated show of apologetics. “In any case, am I to assume then that in addition to the responsibility of tutelage, that the responsibilities of proctorship, examination, and evaluation, have likewise been deferred to *you*?” She shifted gears once more, this time, her question garnered quite a few murmurs to emerge from the rest of the class.

Murmurs which, as the EVI’s little picture-in-picture subtitles hinted at, were all in support of Auris Ping’s right-hand.

*“That’s right… are we to assume that an apprentice of all people will be responsible for the evaluation of our performance?”*

*“I mean, she is an elf, that should count for something right-”*

*“Have some dignity! Just because she’s an elf, doesn’t mean she has any right to be dictating the fate of our academic progress!”*

*“That’s right! This is an insult to our titles! How dare they relegate the tutelage of a class to a mere pitiable apprentice! What do they take us for, the dregs of society?”*

These hot-takes continued escalating further and further, until finally, and seemingly out of nowhere, several of those voices began dying down seemingly mid-sentence; something had distracted them from their little outbursts.

In fact, as the seconds ticked by, Thacea, Thalmin, and Ilunor turned towards each other knowingly, as if sensing that *something* was amiss.

That something was soon made clear to me by a sudden uptick of mana that rose from two, to three, to four hundred percent above background radiation.

At which point, several warnings suddenly slammed my HUD.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 400% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

**CAUTION: Concentrated Heat-Energy Surge Detected!**

**CAUTION: Localized Temperature Surge Detected!**

Those caution reticles quickly formed just behind the apprentice, hovering ominously over that void-filled doorway, right before a stream of concentrated flames surged forwards towards her.

However, instead of dodging, ducking, or leaping out of the way, she stood firm; her features not even shifting even a *little*.

As right before the flames made contact, so too did they suddenly *stop*, as that surge of mana radiation fluctuated wildly—

**ALERT: VARIABLE FREQUENCY FLUCTUATION OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED 200 - 400% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

—before suddenly disappearing.

The room was left stunned.

Any remaining conversations were halted mid way, with many of the more chatty students barely even registering what’d just happened.

So for those who lacked situational awareness, and were still very much looking around for the reason *why* the rest of the class had gone silent, there was a round two to these attacks that erupted as suddenly as the first.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 650% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

This was signaled at first by the cracking of rock and the quaking of the entire room, followed closely by four distinct sinkholes forming along the floor at the very front of the lecture hall. A gurgling, churning noise echoed ominously from deep within the newly-formed holes, like an ancient concrete mixer dialed up to eleven.

Eventually, it stopped.

And soon after, four humanoid earthen behemoths *erupted* from those sinkholes. Each of them easily towered over the apprentice, whilst each of their fists were at least a full Ilunor in size.

A tense confrontation followed, and a silence that could be shattered by a pin drop soon descended upon the formerly whisper-filled room.

Yet despite it all, the apprentice didn’t move a single muscle, and to top it all off her eyes were closed shut as if in deep thought.

Seconds passed.

Then finally, the four cobblestone golems made their move.

All four moved in sync, their first steps caused the whole hall to *shudder*, prompting me to instinctively flinch towards my sidearm as the events of the second day hit me harder than a sack of bricks.

The first golem was poised to strike her side—

**ALERT: VARIABLE FREQUENCY FLUCTUATION OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED 300 - 650% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

—but found itself crumbling before our eyes, as local mana radiation spiked and shifted erratically.

The second golem reached down with its fist, poised to grab the apprentice through the lectern—

**ALERT: VARIABLE FREQUENCY FLUCTUATION OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED 250 - 700% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

—but like the first, it found itself reduced to rubble, falling where it stood; as rock by rock, it collapsed under its own weight.

The third and fourth golems charged forward together, lunging down *fast* towards the lectern—

**ALERT: VARIABLE FREQUENCY FLUCTUATION OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED 350 - 725% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

—but like the first and second, they too found themselves victims to the great equalizer that was gravity, as whatever magical glue was holding them together just up and failed, reducing those humanoid forms into harmless piles of rock.

A few stray rocks *did* reach the lectern, but were effortlessly swatted away by an invisible barrier, leaving the apprentice and her immediate surroundings completely unharmed.

Silence once more descended on the entire class.

But just like the silence from before, that lull period wasn’t destined to last, as a loud, boisterous, and jolly series of bellowing laughs emerged from behind the void of that door.

I could tell, with immediate certainty, who that voice belonged to.

I didn’t even need the EVI’s tag system for this one.

**ENTITY IFF CONFIRMED: A110 Professor Sorecar Latil Almont Pliska - NEXUS \[CORDIAL\]**

“Spectacular work, young apprentice! Spectacular work indeed!” The man came marching through the door, walking up and towards the apprentice.

“Thank you, Professor-Armorer Pliska.” The apprentice responded softly, prompting the armorer to reply with a sharp and brisk bow of his own.

“You can reserve your thanks for *after* class, I have plenty more exercises where that came from, and each and every one is going to be tougher than the last!” The man proclaimed not-so-discreetly, eliciting a worried expression to form on the apprentice’s face, highlighting the seriousness of the otherwise lackadaisical tone of his voice. “Needless to say, I don’t think you’ll be thanking me much after I’m done with you! The Academy’s gotten a bit *softer* over the years, and I’m about to make up for lost time before they toss old-Sorecar Latil Almont Pliska back into the workshop!” He paused, before shifting his tone towards a more *menacing* one. “And that applies to your *understudies* as well, Apprentice.”

“Now!” The armorer quickly shifted his attention from the apprentice, and towards class, his gesticulations *wild*, as if making for the apprentice’s slower, more sluggish demeanor. More specifically, he maintained this sort of “Y” posture, with both arms high above his head as he spoke. “For those of you wondering exactly *what* just happened… well, perhaps it would be best for you to leave the class considering this is *exactly* the sort of thing we’ll both be expecting of you following the conclusion of this school year! And for those of you who openly doubt the qualifications of our dear apprentice here… just know that she was hand-picked by Professor Mal’tory himself for a reason.”The man paused, before bringing his arms back down to his sides, if only to emphasize his point, before resuming the posture from before. “And until I see a single one of you being personally selected by a black, red, blue, or white-robed professor… I don’t want to hear a single *peep* of doubt from you lot. At least as it pertains to the apprentice’s ability to teach these classes! And if you need an extra guarantee of such? Well… know that the Academy does *not* allow an apprentice to teach without supervision from an appointed Professor of the Magical Arts.” He paused, as if for dramatic effect, before pointing both hands down towards himself. “Which just so happens to be the only Professor otherwise free from the burdens of stringent schedules — yours truly!”

To Sorecar’s credit, the murmurs born of inflated egos, and the whispers of dissidence did not once dare to interrupt, or follow-up on the man’s proclamations.

If anything, that entire… *display* was enough to keep the critics at bay, and the ones on the fence to fully hop back on the side of respect.

At least, until one group decided to tempt fate, deploying a privacy screen.

**ALERT: LOCALIZED SURGE OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED, 350% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

If only for that privacy screen to suffer the same effects as the rest of the spells casted throughout class thus far.

**ALERT: VARIABLE FREQUENCY FLUCTUATION OF MANA-RADIATION DETECTED 100 - 350% ABOVE BACKGROUND RADIATION LEVELS**

“Bold! Brash! And indeed, *cheeky*, if that word still holds true in this era’s vernacular!” Sorecar announced with a laugh that radiated *deep* from within his armor. “Unlike other classes that *prohibit* the casting of magic save for practice or demonstrative purposes, I fully allow it, nay, I say, I *encourage* it! You youths should be *free* to cast magic whenever and however you like!” The man paused soon after, and once again shifted gears towards a more severe timbre, yet never once losing that lackadaisical personality I knew him for. “But just remember, while you may freely practice these magical gifts you have and hold so highly, doing such in this class is to be considered a direct *challenge* by yours truly! This is the study of Light Magic and Mana-field Perception, after all! And thus, in the spirit of *scholarly competition*, I shall take every spell cast as a chance to prove what’s what!”

The man paused, before gesturing towards the apprentice. “Now, for those of you still quite confused with the *definition* of Light Magic as it pertains to the *Nexian* vernacular, I shall defer the right of tutelage back to that of our dear Apprentice. The floor is yours, my lady.”

A brief exchange of bows between the teaching duo was had, before the apprentice finally started, now with all doubts and concerns fully addressed not just by words alone, but through action as well.

“As all of you may have already discerned, the demonstration Professor Pliska had so graciously provided, was an attempt to illustrate the most visible effects of Light Magic — that being the detection and subsequent *dispelling* of active and pre-active spells. The subject of *Light magic*, thus refers to the study of the detection, dispelling, counterspelling, and disarming of *all forms* of other magics.”

“And by that definition, it is the single most *combative* field of magic there is.” Sorecar promptly chimed in with a nod towards the apprentice, almost like he was tag-teaming this opening statement with her; establishing a precedent for the dynamics of the class. “For in order to practice Light Magic, one must be in the presence of an active spell. And in order to *truly* practice Light Magic, one must be in the presence of active *danger*, as unlike most forms of magic, unevenness and intensity in casting is key to the successful destabilization of an offending spell.”

“*So THAT’S what the fluctuations were.*” I thought to myself outloud inside my helmet.

“Moreover—” Sorecar continued, raising his arms into the air once again as if to emphasize his points. “—to the seasoned and the wise, Light Magic as a field is known to be the single most versatile field in existence. For if implemented correctly, it has the capacity to bring all other forms of magic to its knees.”

“Versatility and adaptability are core elements of Light Magic, so while not capable of much harm by itself, it is capable of incredible feats of defense if used correctly.”

To say that I was pleasantly surprised would’ve been an understatement by this point. Because not only was Mal’tory completely out for the count, and not only was he replaced by *two* of my only cordial relations within the Academy thus far, but the class *itself* was refreshingly straightforward. There was no mincing around words like Vanavan’s class of lectures, there was also no overt signs of blatant propaganda and indoctrination like in Articord’s class. Instead, this whole class started out with a *practical demo* of all things, followed up essentially with a breakdown of exactly *what* we were studying.

“What you observed during the start of class, were just two out of a near-infinite set of examples demonstrating counterspell and dispelling measures, a rather dramatic one I might add but one that you may very well one day use.” The apprentice continued following yet another exchange of nods with Sorecar.

“And indeed, while they may have seemed *trivial* to the keen-eyed observer, the execution of their dispelling is anything *but*. Because despite what most misinformed minds may believe regarding counterspelling — dispelling isn’t simply a matter of overpowering an offending spell with a burst of mana, but instead, more akin to the unwinding of a knot, or the picking of a lock. You must act to *untangle* a spell, until the spell itself falls apart at the seams.” Sorecar continued, before once again swapping the baton with Larial through an exchange of nods.

“Which is exactly why *Light Magic* continues to be a field forever expanding in its domain.” The apprentice continued. “Because as every *other* field develops more and more convoluted forms of spells and artificing, so too does Light Magic have to adapt, improvise, and overcome these advanced and oftentimes eclectic means of casting.”

*So an arms race…* I thought to myself.

“It is, in essence, a *pure magic* field. Yet it is applied as if it were an *applied magical* field of study.” Sorecar surmised, prompting me to actually listen in with genuine intent, this marking the first moment I was truly engaged with a class with none of its politics.

“And as for the Mana-Field Perception class?” The apprentice continued with an inquisitive tone of voice. “It’s effectively an extension, or rather, a foundational element of Light Magic depending on how one wishes to view it. Because in order to become proficient in Light Magic, you have to first understand and hone your abilities in order to *detect* the nuances within mana-streams and mana-fields. It is only through the detection of disruptions and the accurate understanding of a spell being cast, that you are able to apply more advanced abjurations in an attempt to counter these spells. Sometimes even *before* they’re cast if you’re so inclined to.”

“Now, how many of you can genuinely say you noticed the shift in the room’s aura *prior* to the casting of that Firestream?” Sorecar asked the crowd, prompting almost every hand to be raised.

“Well that’s just a blatant lie now, isn’t it?” The man retorted bluntly. “I can tell by your reactions just before the Flamespear hit, you know. So please, *honestly now*, I’m giving you one more chance to answer.”

About three quarters of the class lowered their hands, leaving only the gang, Auris Ping and Qiv’s group, as well as a few other scattered students to maintain their raised hands.

“Alright, that’s about *exactly* the number I counted from behind the veil! Rightio then!” Sorecar proclaimed through what I could only imagine would’ve been a grin if it wasn’t for his armor. “This is exactly why mana-field perception is necessary. Because to most mages, it is a *learned* skill rather than an inherent *trait*. Which, of course, is by no means a demerit! But moreso, a wonderful little oddity in the grander tapestry that is the magical arts and pedagogue!”

The apprentice quickly followed that up with a series of talks once more summarizing the expectations of the class. Mana-field perception was, unsurprisingly, divided into practical and theoretical assessments. Which, at first, seemed to be a potential roadblock, until I realized one fundamental way this class could actually benefit my aims.

“EVI?” I spoke inwardly, as Larial started her lectures on mana-field perception.

**“Yes, Cadet Booker?”**

“Is there any chance you can maybe interpolate and extrapolate on the Apprentice’s points? As in, is it possible to… visualize magic, as opposed to just alerting me to bursts of it?”

**“The mana-radiation visualization project, or MRVP, has been in development for some time, Cadet Booker. The research and development teams however, were unable to create a reliable model for field-use that wouldn’t have been a liability to operations.”**

“So it wasn’t field-deployable because of the variance and accuracy issue.”

**“Correct, Cadet Booker.”**

“Alright, and you said all they needed was more data to create a better model for it, right?”

**“Correct, Cadet Booker.”**

“Could you… do that with this? Is that within your mission parameters to do so?”

**“It is indeed one of the many ongoing projects taking up the bulk of my processing capacity, Cadet Booker. However, proper implementation of this will require additional hardware to be developed, tested, and then field-deployed for testing. The success rate of which is yet to be determined. I cannot guarantee this operation will yield the desired results inferred, Cadet Booker.”**

“Alright, that’s good enough for me.” I acknowledged, before turning back to class with a renewed sense of invigoration.

The lecture continued, only stopping about midway as the apprentice realized she’d yet to elaborate on the whole *Light Magic* class side of things.

Which, it turns out, was more or less similar to Mana-field perception in its assessment criteria — that being a mix of practical and theory assessments. A combination of written exams and practical counterspelling would be expected in tests, midterms, and finals. This would mark my first true hurdle… but then again, perhaps I could balance out the rest of my grades against the practicals which was more or less an impossibility given my obvious human limitations…

“As with most of the classes in the first year, I will treat *both* periods as one. As both subjects are intertwined, we may see glimpses of both within the same period.” The apprentice continued, before shifting gears towards something else. “And on the topic of periods, since we’re nearing the conclusion of the first, with lunch quickly coming upon us, I believe it to be necessary to inform everyone now of what awaits at the *end* of this second period.” The apprentice spoke ominously, as she made the effort of meeting every one of the students’ gazes. “By day’s end, I intend for a pair of you to perform a *practical* demonstration of the fundamentals of light magic. So I expect everyone to pay close attention after lunch.”

A small pause punctuated the room yet again, before Sorecar, after several hours of silence, came to complete the apprentice’s thoughts; his faceplate squeaked to form a shape that just barely gave off the feeling of a smirk.

“Be prepared, and be ready, for your first real brush with magical dueling.”

“*First* being the operative word here, I must add.” The apprentice quickly clarified. “Within the bounds of *demonstrative purposes*.”

I could just about hear the band rounding out the corner outside the hall, and I could just about see a few students ready to pack up their things for lunch.

However, before the band could arrive, Thalmin unexpectedly stood up, raising his hand in the process.

“Yes, Prince Thalmin Havenbrock?” The apprentice acknowledged.

“I wish to volunteer as the issuer of this duel, and to designate the other party for this duel as well.”

The apprentice paused, considering this carefully, before nodding. “Granted, though I warn you Prince Havenbrock, this is an *introductory* demonstration, and will be treated as such. In any case, who would you wish to designate as the other party?”

“Lord Auris Ping.”

2020-09-09 15:47:42,"What happened to the children of Hamelin? The dark truth to the Pied Piper. Most people are familiar with the story of the Pied Piper. There are several versions of the legend, and although the details vary slightly, the premise is always the same; the city of Hamelin is suffering a plague of rats. A mysterious stranger wearing colorful (pied) clothing appears claiming that he can help, and is hired for a specific sum.  The stranger plays his magic flute, which causes all the rats to follow him. The Piper leads the rats to their doom (in some versions into the river, in some versions it’s unspecified) and comes back to collect his fee. However, the city refuses to pay him. Furious, the Piper again plays his flute, except this time it’s the town’s children who follow him. He leads the children away, and neither they nor the Piper are ever seen again

What many people don’t realize is that this dark tale seems to be based off of a very real and tragic episode in Hamelin’s past. A plaque on Hamelin’s “Pied Piper House”, which dates to 1602, reads ““A.D. 1284 – on the 26th of June – the day of St John and St Paul – 130 children – born in Hamelin – were led out of the town by a piper wearing multicoloured clothes. After passing the Calvary near the Koppenberg they disappeared forever.””  There are historical accounts of a stained glass window dating to 1300 in St. Nicolai’s Church showing the Pied Piper leading the children away, inscribed with the words ""On the day of John and Paul 130 children in Hamelin went to Calvary and were brought through all kinds of danger to the Koppen mountain and lost."" (The window was destroyed in the 1600s). An account dating to 1450 known as the Lüneburg manuscript, tells of a monk who states that a man in his 30s wearing multi-colored clothes came to the town and led the children away.  Perhaps the earliest account of what really happened in Hamelin is a note in the town's ledger from 1384, stating “It is 100 years since our children left.”

What’s notable about all of these accounts is that the date is always the same-the Feast of St. John and St. Paul (June 26th) of 1284-and the number of children (130) is likewise consistent.

So what actually happened in Hamelin? Some theories suggest that the Piper was actually a recruiter who was organizing migrants, and used his colorful clothing and pipe to attract potential settlers. Possible locations for this migration include Transylvania or Berlin, where family names common in Hamelin show up with surprising frequency. Another theory is that the Piper was recruiting children for a Crusade.

Some speculate that the story is a metaphor for a plague that came and wiped out the children, and the Piper is a stand-in for Death, although the question remains why no adults were affected.

A very interesting theory involves what’s known as “dancing mania”, a form of mass hysteria. As the BBC describes, “... the dance could spread from individuals to large groups, all driven by an unshakeable compulsion to dance feverishly, sometimes for weeks, often leaping and singing and sometimes hallucinating to the point of exhaustion and occasionally death, like a top that can’t stop spinning.” There was actually a documented case of dancing mania in the 13th century in the town of Erfurt, south of Hamelin, where several children literally danced themselves to death.

One more theory has to do with the date the children disappeared. Besides being a Christian Feast Day, June 26th was the date of the pagan midsummer celebrations. Some scholars suggest that the children were being led to the festivities, when a local Christian faction, hoping to wipe out the pagan practices, either intercepted the group and slaughtered them, or kidnapped them and forced them into monasteries.

It’s likely the truth about what happened in Hamelin will never be known for sure. What’s is sure is that the Piper, whoever or whatever he was, had a larger impact on the world than anyone could ever have thought at the time.

Sacajawea leaned back, staring at the hologram in the middle of the table.

""I fled the Glassing. I asked Luke to rebirth my people, help me get the colony ships working, then ran for it,"" she said. ""Twelve ships lifted off, escorted by light attack and defense craft,"" she closed her eyes. ""Only four made it. The Mantid boarded two of the ships,"" she swallowed thickly. ""I could hear them scream as the Mantid killed them.""

Legion squeezed her hand gently.

N'Skrek could see the pain in her features.

*For her, it may be thousands of years ago, but it still brings pain,* he thought to himself. *For me, for all of us at this table, this is an event tens of thousands of years ago. Barely remembered history.*

""We stayed in jumpspace for months, years, pushing at the upper bands,"" she shook her head. ""We eventually hit the point where the ships were pushed back down by the pressure.""

N'Skrek nodded. The upper jumpspace bands required specialized engines and jumpcores.

""We used cryogenics to make the trips,"" she said. ""We would exit jumpspace, refuel at a far orbit gas giant that was not frozen, then jump again,"" she shook her head. ""All I could think of was to run as far and as fast as I could, and bring my people with me.""

She began drawing lines.

""Hundreds of years passed while we slept, a dreamless sleep,"" Sacajawea said. ""We ran until the ships could run no more. Two of them failed exiting jumpspace, but we were lucky. By that time I understood that each jump could be our last, so I ensured that we headed toward stellar systems that had a high probability of a planet we could survive on.""

She shook her head.

""I never entered cryo-sleep. I stayed awake, guiding our path,"" she inhaled sharply and exhaled slowly. ""I could *feel* our path. I *knew* which way to go.""

Luke held up one finger, getting everyone's attention.

""The Digital Omnimessiah, he changed us with his touch. Each of us with our own part to play to save humanity,"" he said. He glanced at Sacajawea. ""She can see, feel probabilities and adjust to a shifting situation with nearly precognizant accuracy.""

Sacajawea rolled her eyes and sniffed, pursing her lips. ""You make it sound so pedestrian.""

Luke just smiled.

""For hundreds of years I stood on the bridge of a damaged colony ship, my pointing finger our only guide,"" she said.

N'Skrek noted that her voice had fallen into a sing-song cadence.

""Finally I saw the six suns, arranged in the shape of an eagle,"" she said. ""I knew, at that moment, that this would be as far as we could go. Our ships were failing, but they could make this last leg of our journey. I chose the best one for my people. It was nearly paradise, just needing a little bit of tweaking. No life higher than plant life and simple insects, perfect to live away from hatred, war, and slaughter.""

She looked down.

""I led them to their doom,"" she said softly. ""We had to rely on high technology at first. Terraformers, the gene banks that Luke had acquired, orbital lift capacity.""

She shook her head. ""Little did we know that the technology would attract what you call the Mar-gite.""

N'Skrek shook his head. ""No. You were just in the way,"" he said.

She looked startled.

""If the planet had carbon based life or an oxygen heavy atmosphere, they would have devoured it,"" N'Skrek said. He shrugged. ""It's what they do. Before recently, we thought they were some kind of locust that just denuded planets and moved on.""

""Now we know that they're a weapon, being driven in front of another species,"" Admiral Breakheader said.

She blinked several times, then turned to Luke.

""True story,"" Luke shrugged.

Sacajawea was silent for a long moment, then she shivered and touched the hologram again.

""I guided my people along the True Path, the one that promised the most happiness and most reward,"" she said. She glanced at Luke. ""Those who wished to embrace more technology had their own spaces, although I did not dwell with them.""

She looked down at where Luke was still holding her hand.

""For thousands of years, six thousand of our years,"" she said. ""Then the Outsiders came.""

""How long Confederate Standard?"" Admiral Breakheader asked, rubbing his chin.

N'Skrek could hear the rustle of bristles from the Vice-Admiral's five-o-clock shadow.

Sacajawea closed her eyes. ""Almost six thousand to the day.""

Breakheader nodded, making a note.

""At first, they just appeared in out of the way locations. Someone would see them and they'd flee, move away, and eventually they started to show up more and more near the technological enclaves,"" Sacajawea shook her head. ""It was the technology that they were attracted to.""

N'Skrek just nodded.

""Then came the attacks. Our superluminal communication links went first, but not before we learned that we were being attacked on all six worlds simultaneously. We held them off for years, protecting ourselves. No matter what path I looked at, I could see no path that had a statistically viable path to victory, I could only minimize their victories,"" she closed her eyes. ""They began capturing my people, abducting whole villages.""

""Then came the Devouring Ones,"" she said. ""Two years later, and we were gone.""

Breakheader nodded.

""Initial scouting, followed by an assault, then research, then finished with an extermination attack,"" he said. He looked up. ""Standard xenocide tactics.""

Sacajawea looked way.

""He's right,"" Luke said. She looked at him, surprised. ""You put up too stiff of a fight so they brought in their heavy hitters after getting a good look at how we worked.""

There was silence for a moment, then Commander Hentrill looked up from her datapad. ""How did you die?"" she asked.

""What difference does it make?"" Sacajawea asked.

Hentrill looked unfazed by the glare that Sacajawea aimed down her nose at her. ""It makes a lot of difference, Ma'am,"" she said cooly.

N'Skrek could feel that Hentrill had developed a dislike for the Immortal over the course of the conversation.

""When they came for me, when I was the last, I stepped from the cliff and fell to the rocks below, where the waves washed against the shore. By the time they reached me, I had died from my injuries,"" Sacajawea said. ""I sang as I fell so that...""

""Suicide. They gathered your lifeless corpse,"" Hentrill said. She narrowed her eyes. ""You have a standard datalink for the Glassing Era. Did you have one when you fell?""

Sacajawea nodded. ""It was on piece of technology that I felt was necessary to embrace,"" she said.

""So, you killed yourself and the enemy obtained your datalink and your brain,"" Hentrill said. ""What about your leaders? You did have military leaders, yes?""

Sacajawea glanced at Luke, who nodded. ""Yes. I convinced Luke to bring back great leaders of my people and I nurtured their spirits as I raised them during the trip.""

""Did they have datalinks?"" Hentrill asked.

Sacajawea nodded. ""Yes. I had been told, repeatedly, that effective communication was vital to winning a war.""

""Daxin,"" Luke interjected.

Sacajawea sniffed. ""Yes.""

Hentrill made a note. ""Were your leaders targeted early in the conflict?"" she asked.

""Of course,"" Sacajawea said. ""Many were killed, but the technology we had allowed them to return within days, only missing a few days of their previous life. Luke had convinced Peter to ensure we had a version of the SUDS, which we only used for critically important people.""

N'Skrek saw a muscle twitch next to Luke's eye, but he stayed smiling.

""But it was destroyed before the Devourers came,"" Sacajawea said. ""It could not be helped. There was almost no path I could take that would prevent it from being destroyed, so I chose the path that would result in the least casualties for my people.""

N'Skrek was not that familiar with Terrans, but he could tell that Commander Hentrill was rubbed the wrong way by that statement.

""I think we should take a break,"" N'Skrek said. He nodded toward Luke. ""I am sure both of you are fatigued from being brought back from the dead.""

""Yes,"" Sacajawea said before Luke could do much more than open his mouth. ""I would prefer to have privacy to rest and perform necessary rites.""

N'Skrek just nodded. ""I'll be sure you get privacy.""

Legion stood next to the tank, one hand on the heavily armored skirt, staring at the black metal the tank was made from.

""Warsteel Mark-IV,"" he whispered to himself. He shook his head. ""We are old friends, you and I,"" he said softly, running one hand across the metal. ""Later superseded by arcanochromium for the Mark-V.""

He didn't care if anyone heard him talking to the tank. There was just a single Telkan in the vehicle bay, running diagnostic checks on one of the big Telkan armored transports used  for power armor troops.

*^(your name is luke)*

He shook his head, reaching up to pinch the bridge of his nose. He kept hearing slight buzzing whispers.

He felt her before he could see her. Felt her leave the lift, the warsteel doors pulling open and letting her presence roll out to fill the vehicle bay.

He heard her shoes clicking and closed his eyes, sighing.

*It's not her. Not the one you knew. It's Tiffany, not Sacajawea,* he thought to himself.

*^(your name is luke)*

He looked up just in time to see a green mantid wave shyly at him.

He smiled at it and waved back just as Sacajawea stopped next to him.

""A green mantid?"" she said, her voice slightly fearful.

""Engineer caste,"" Luke said. ""They like me.""

""They are Mantid,"" Sacajawea said, her voice cold and hard.

""The war was thousands of years ago, and even if it wasn't, he is blameless in it,"" Luke said.

""But it is a Mantid,"" Sacajawea said. She watched coldly as the little green mantid waved and rushed away.

""I have more in common with him than I do with the majority of humanity,"" Luke said softly.

Sacajawea scoffed. ""Surely not.""

Luke nodded. ""His kind was trapped inside their own minds. Capable of thought, artistic expression, fear, love, affection, all of it,"" he ran one finger along the armored track skirt of the tank, a fat purple spark jumping from between his finger and the black armor. ""The whole war, until the Mechakrautlanders killed that Overqueen, they were inside their own little heads, screaming endlessly.""

He ran his finger again, watching another spark jump out.

""When green mantids cluster up, their intelligence increases. Not by leaps and bounds, just slightly, but the bigger part is, they could feel the ones around them screaming but were unable to reach out and touch them,"" he said. He was silent a moment. ""I understand them, they understand me. Both of us, bred and created to merely serve, without any thought as to our souls.""

He turned arounds, looking at Sacajawea.

""They are among the Digital Omnimessiah's most fervent believers, and one of humanity's staunchest allies,"" he said. He motioned at the tanks around them. ""You have been gone a long time, little sister.""

""And you, did you live through the forty-thousand years? What did you do?"" Sacajawea asked.

Luke shook his head. ""I retreated. After the War in Heaven and in Hell, after the Flashbang, I retreated,"" he said. ""I spent most of my time at Atlantis, which led to me being more or less imprisoned, away from the galaxy.""

He flashed a smile.

""At least I had the Detainee for company. She's an interesting conversationalist.""

Sacajawea just sniffed, looking around. ""What is that?"" she asked, pointing at the lone Telkan, who had just straightened up from the tracks and was wiping his hands off with a rag.

""A Telkan. An full member species of the Confederacy, an ally to humanity, who took part in the War in Heaven,"" Luke said. He waved at the Telkan, who waved back, and went back to inspecting  the vehicle.

""It looks like a fox,"" Sacajawea said.

Luke cut her off with a motion of his hand. ""I swear to God, you start talking to me about how they obviously embody the trickster spirit of the fox and thus are untrustworthy I'll put you right back where I found you,"" he said sharply.

Sacajawea pursed her lips in irritation.

""You have to let go. Let go of your preconceived notions. Let go of all the old hurts. It's been eight-thousand years for you and forty-thousand for the universe,"" Luke said softly, turning back to running his hand over the armor on the tank. ""Even Daxin could see that.""

Sacajawea snorted. ""Like Daxin ever saw anything that wasn't in the sights of his guns.""

Luke turned around, his jaw clenched. ""You don't speak bad about him in my presence again,"" he snapped, drawing himself up to full height. ""Not now, not ever again,"" he leaned forward slightly. ""You weren't here. You *left* us, the Digital Omnimessiah was dead, and we were all bereft,"" sparks jumped out from under his boots and under the palm that rested on the tank's armor. ""True, I spent over a thousand years running from him, but he was still my brother. It hurt more than anything not to be at his side when he died.""

Sacajawea looked around at the tanks and armored vehicles. ""He fell on some battlefield,"" she said. It was less a question and more a statement.

Luke shook his head. ""No. He died, in his sleep, surrounded by his family. His children, grand-children, and great-grand children. He was finally at peace,"" he sighed. ""When he arrived in Afterlife, he waited patiently for his wife and even though I wanted to spend time with him,"" he sighed again. ""It was time to let the Walking War Crime rest.""

Luke turned and faced Sacajawea. ""In your mind, we are still the same as we were,"" he said gently. He reached out and took her hand in his. ""But that is no longer true. We grew, we set aside old differences, we set aside old hatreds, and we moved forward rather than holding tight to the past.""

She sniffed, looking away, but not pulling her hand away. ""I have seen the history. A history of lies that glosses over the crimes and bloodshed.""

""Temporal warfare counter-measures,"" Luke said. ""After The Glassing, history and culture was lost. It was rebuilt from oral tales and fragmented records.""

""Lies,"" she said again.

""Weaponized,"" Luke said. He pulled his hand free, jamming both hands into his pockets. ""It's protected Terra, protected everyone, even your people, more than once. When the Atrekna came, that was probably the only thing that saved our people,"" he stared at her. ""Saved humanity.""

""So they don't care about the truth?"" she asked.

""What truth? That thousands of years ago an aggressive Mantid hive wrecked up Earth? Nobody cares any more,"" he said. ""That's the thing about them. They aren't like us. We can easily remember the Glassing. For them, it's a few paragraphs in a history book they read in school. Maybe some scholars look at that era,"" he looked up at the lights. ""For the majority of humanity, the Glassing is as far and remote as the light of the stars in the sky,"" he looked back down. ""And that's a good thing.""

""I do not understand you,"" Sacajawea said.

*^(she never did)*

*^(not like i do)*

*^(luke)*

""You never did,"" Luke said. ""*You* never did. She eventually understood me.""

*^(that's right)*

*^(i understand you)*

""You cloned me without my consent,"" she accused. She crossed her arms. ""I await your justifications.""

Luke just smiled. ""I did. I cloned you without your consent. I told your clone that it was a clone,"" he looked up. ""Then the Imperium caught us, turned us into the Immortals. Used her as a seer to determine how to reach victory, but she held information back and Daxin, at the head of the Martial Orders of Terra, broke the Imperium over his knee.""

He looked back down. ""Afterwards, she worked tirelessly on the Terra Restoration Project. While I was busy running, she returned to Terra, sought out the survivors of her people, and helped them restore their lands and way of life.""

Sacajawea looked away. ""As did I.""

Luke chuckled. ""She used temporal lensing to look back into the past, see the reality of the old ways, watch the rituals and daily life of the ancestors, and restored them.""

""Yet, the history books are full of lies,"" Sacajawea sniffed.

""After the Second Temporal War, she understood and embraced the counter-warfare protocols. She helped interweave your people into the tales,"" Luke said. ""Was it all lies? Partly. Like the best ones, it had good heaping helping of truth hidden inside the metaphors and personifications of events.""

""And where is she now?"" Sacajawea asked, watching the Telkan inspect the running gears of the armored vehicle.

""She led the Sky Nebula Alignment fleet. She led our peoples, *all* our peoples, to someplace where our enemies would not find us,"" Luke said. He turned and ran his hand over the armor again. ""I stayed behind. I never lost faith that the Digital Omnimessiah would return.""

He lifted his palm and made small figure eights on the armor with his fingertips.

""I loved her, so I let her go,"" he said softly. ""She had seen it was the only way our people would survive a coming darkness.""

He looked at Sacajawea. ""She was right.""

Sacajawea looked at where Luke was making small figure eights with his fingers on the armor. ""There is no good path for me to take. All of them are risky, most of them I will perish,"" she said. She reached out and took his hand. ""My best chances for survival is to flee,"" she lifted his hand and grasped it with both of hers.

""Come with me. Let us leave. You can take us elsewhere, where we have a chance of survival,"" she tilted her head to encompass the vehicle bay. ""Too many of these paths lead to both our deaths. There are too few that lead to a place where we both survive.""

Luke delicately removed his hand from hers, using one hand to lift her fingers from her grip on his hand one by one.

""No.""

Sacajawea frowned. ""No? Together, we can go somewhere else where we have a better chance to stand up to whatever comes and have a possibility of triumphing at a later date,"" she waved at the armored vehicles. ""This way, the way that Treana'ad commander is taking us, is rife with nothing but death and destruction.""

Luke stared at her for a long moment.

""You never understood,"" he said softly. ""Your desire, your drive, to save your people, and yourself, blind you to the things that must be done,"" he put one hand on the tank again. ""That sometimes the only path forward to success is the one fraught with the most danger, hardship, and suffering.""

He turned away and started walking deeper into the vehicle bay.

""She understood,"" he said softly.

""I am not her,"" Sacajawea said.

""Obviously.""

Sacajawea just sniffed and turned away, leaving the bay.

*^(your name is luke)*

By the tank, Jaskel wondered why the hell they'd chosen that particular bay for their little spat.

He looked at 8814, who was still practially hopping from foot to foot with happiness.

""I'm glad you got to meet him,"" Jaskel said honestly.

Dhruv sat in the shadowy room, wearing a pair of exercise shorts, waiting.

Finally, he could smell cigarette smoke and a *presence* filled the room.

""What?"" a voice asked from the shadows. The end of a cigarette brightened as a drag was taken off of it, briefly illuminating gun-metal gray eyes and severe cheekbones.

""I want a favor,"" Dhruv said.

He could feel the smile even if he couldn't see it.

""People in my care want ice water,"" the woman's voice commanded.

""I want you to look up SUDS records for me. I need you to process some of them so I can either talk to them or see their last moments,"" Luke said. He looked away from the glow of the cigarette. ""Records from a long time ago.""

""If I decide to do this, I'll need specifics,"" the woman said, exhaling smoke that curled into the figure of a man on his knees, face in his hand, sobbing.

""I'll provide them. They should be easy to find via their x, y, z, q coordinates,"" Luke said.

""Now for the big question,"" the woman said, chuckling.

""What?"" Luke asked.

""Why should I help you?"" the woman asked.

""Because I'm willing to make a deal with the Devil,"" Legion said.

This time he could see the glint of teeth in the smile.

**UPDATE 39: ISLEWEAVER**

Return to Duviri in Isleweaver! 

Return to the floating Kingdom of Duviri, a land of fables and stories, to push back the latest incursion of the Indifference! Major Neci Rusalka has resurfaced among the floating isles — and she's brought the Murmur with her. Equip your Warframes and embark into Duviri with your full Arsenal in an exciting new gameplay twist!

The **Isleweaver Duviri node** is here! The once forgotten Scholar’s Landing Isle of Duviri is wrought with Murmur, and Dominus Thrax has requested your aid to fend them off and sever access to his Kingdom. A decree for the unrestricted use of your Warframe has been made to push Rusalka and her Murmur minions out. However, the Murmur aren’t the only ones serving Rusalka… a poisonous predator lurks deep in the Isle, waiting for prey to fall into her lair. 

The time-limited **Operation: Eight Claw** takes place in the Isleweaver node and begins today @ 11:30 AM until July 16th. It’s worth noting that the Isleweaver node is available to play now, but Operation specific events and rewards will only begin at 11:30 AM ET. Dominus Thrax has opened up a shop with Operation specific items for you to claim as thanks for cleaning out the cobwebs. Community progress in the Operation also contributes to the unlocking of special **Invictus Signas**! Read more on that in the Operation: Eight Claw section of the patch notes! 

The 61st Warframe **Oraxia** has leaped onto the scene! She is the evolution of a perfect hunter. Weave her silken strands yourself or become ensnared by them in Scholar’s Landing. Oraxia also comes with her signature weapons the **Scyotid** secondary and **Spinnerex** whip melee. 

So much more has threaded its way into this update, including the new Incarnon Scythe Thalys, Valkyr’s rework, new TennoGen, new Warframe Augment Mods (Kullervo, Citrine, Caliban and Jade), a plethora of New Player Experience changes, Quality of Life changes, new Hex KIM conversations, and a hearty list of fixes – turns out this web really can catch bugs. 

Duviri’s new tale is being told with your name written in its pages. Will you be triumphant, Drifter? 

**Note:** Please be aware that**** this update includes depictions of spider-like creatures. 

Update 39 is a Mainline Update! 

Meaning that everything the team has been working on since the launch of Update 38.6.0: Yareli Prime is in this update (with the obvious exception of content that is not ready to be released). It is very likely, as it is with all Mainline updates, that things slip through the cracks so we will be watching for bug reports and feedback in the dedicated [Isleweaver subforums](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/2097-update-39-isleweaver/) to address in follow-up Hotfixes.

If any of the terms above are new to you, visit [The Warframe Lexicon for Updates](https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1355354-the-warframe-lexicon-for-updates-patch-notes/) to learn more about Warframe’s development cycle. 

**Download Sizes:**

  * **DirectX 11:** ~2.05 GB
    * The DirectX 11 build is smaller as this update shipped optimizations that made shaders smaller for a minor load-time cost.
  * **DirectX 12:** ~ 3.26 GB

**NEW DUVIRI NODE: ISLEWEAVER**

A familiar face, an unlikely ally. Dominus Thrax calls for aid — the Kingdom of Duviri has been invaded by the Murmur, led by the newly resurfaced Major Neci Rusalka. Don the Hero of Duviri mantle once more as you face off against this new threat.****

**Prerequisite:** The Hex Quest must be completed to access this node. 

**Scholar’s Landing** , a once-forgotten isle of Duviri, is now under Rusalka’s control. Here the Murmur’s influence is strongest, and here you must put up your strongest offence.

[da82ea4be2d1b65fac68419bf516e2d5.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/da82ea4be2d1b65fac68419bf516e2d5.png)

**Warframes in Duviri**

While in the Isleweaver node, your Warframes take the spotlight. Select your loadout from the available equipment in Teshin’s Cave, and gain access to them immediately upon stepping foot into Duviri. While Dominus Thrax has graciously allowed your Warframe into his Kingdom, Companions and Gear Items remain unwelcome in his realm.

As Gear cannot be used, the Gear Wheel input can be used instead to summon your Kaithe!

[e3da756bc61de67fda4c89164eacb567.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/e3da756bc61de67fda4c89164eacb567.png)

**Isleweaver Node**

The Isleweaver node brings you into a new story: the tale of **The Triumph of Dust**. Rusalka aims to write a new ending in her favor, and you’re tasked with stopping her. Isleweaver mirrors The Lone Story mission structure, but with a twist: play through six objectives and face a formidable foe at the end. 

  1. Duviri Objective
  2. Duviri Objective or Undercroft
  3. Duviri Objective or Undercroft
  4. Duviri Objective or Undercroft
  5. Oraxia’s Lair
  6. Duviri Objective or Undercroft
  7. Summon The Fragmented  




Many of your objectives will feel familiar, but are corrupted by Rusalka’s touch. **Oraxia’s Lair is a required objective in every Isleweaver session, and involves depictions of spider-like creatures. Please be aware.** To learn more about this fight, we’ve detailed it in the “New Mini-Boss: Oraxia’s Lair” section below!

In lieu of the Orowyrm, face off against two of The Fragmented* at once to complete the Spiral. 

Isleweaver offers the following guaranteed rewards upon completion:

  * Scuttler Husks (3-5 on Normal Path, 5-8 on Steel Path)
  * Pathos Clamps (10 on Normal Path, 15 on Steel Path)
  * 5 Steel Essence (Steel Path Only)



Players also receive items from Oraxia’s droptables, awarded upon opening the chest at the end of The Fragmented fight. Below is a list of key items that drop from Oraxia, but refer to the [official Drop Tables Site](https://warframe-web-assets.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/cms/hnfvc0o3jnfvc873njb03enrf56.html) for full details:

  * Oraxia main and Component Blueprints
  * Scyotid main and Component Blueprints
  * Spinnerex main and Component Blueprints 
  * Temporal Dust (new resource) 
  * Enigma Gyrum



Since this node mirrors The Lone Story, side objectives are not available to play. Keep on-mission, kiddo. 

*Note: The Fragmented in Duviri have a separate drop table from their Deimos counterparts, meaning the Cavia Arcanes will not be obtainable from this fight.  


**Contain the Threat**

The rest of Duviri must be protected from Major Neci Rusalka’s hold. As such, The Triumph of Dust has been contained from the rest of the landscape. Players will be unable to journey to other parts of Duviri whilst playing the Isleweaver node. 

While you can’t explore the rest of Thrax’s Kingdom in Isleweaver, there is still much to uncover. Secrets are littered throughout Scholar’s Landing, tokens of Rusalka’s influence. A keen eye (or ear) can suss them out.   


**New Resources**

Two new resources are available from the Isleweaver node: **Scuttler Husks** and **Temporal Dust**. 

**Scuttler Husks:**

Earned upon defeating The Fragmented at the end of the Isleweaver Spiral, Scuttler Husks can be exchanged for a variety of rewards. 

Visit Dominus Thrax and/or Acrithis to spend your Scuttler Husks on the following:

  * Oraxia’s Main and Component Blueprints
  * Scyotid’s Main and Component Blueprints (Thrown Secondary) 
  * Spinnerex’s Main and Component Blueprints (Whip Melee)
  * Thalys Incarnon Heavy Scythe Weapon Blueprint
  * Captura Scenes: 
    * Duviri Throne Room Scene
    * Octopede Arena Scene
    * Scholar’s Landing Scene
    * Isleweaver Cloud Islet Scene
    * Isleweaver Drift Atoll Scene



**Temporal Dust:**

The dust of decayed universes, rich in entropy. Entrati’s research postulates it as the animating agent of the nightmarish Murmur.

Temporal Dust drops from The Murmur in the Isleweaver mission, and is a crafting component for new content introduced in this update.   


**New Mini-Boss: Oraxia’s Lair**

“Oraxia. The Scholar's pet. I heard the Usurper imitating his voice. The spider is her servant now.”

Descend through the webbed maw when the time is right during **the Triumph of Dust** story spiral in the Isleweaver Duviri node. Here you will face Oraxia, Albrecht’s guardian Warframe, who served him during his time in Duviri. Driven mad by the feverish whispering of the Indifference, she now serves Major Neci Rusalka. 

Successfully taking down Oraxia and her Scuttlers will earn you Scuttler Husks* to redeem with Dominus Thrax and/or Acrithis in the Dormizone for Oraxia’s Blueprints, as well as Blueprints for her signature weapons — the Spinnerex Whip and Scyotid Secondary.  
  
*Note: Scuttler Husks are awarded upon completion of the Isleweaver Spiral, similar to Kullervo’s Bane.  


[520f8a40efac82c2b43d7a206817b335.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/520f8a40efac82c2b43d7a206817b335.png)

**New Murmur Enemy: The Unseeing Herald**

The Unseeing Herald proclaims the will of the Indifference, uttering its twisted desires in Voidtongue. Who among us has heard its whispers?

You’ll encounter this new Murmur enemy in the Isleweaver Duviri node. Much like the other Murmur enemies in Scholar’s Landing, they drop Temporal Dust (a new resource used to craft Oraxia, her weapons, and the new Thalys Incarnon).  


[f7c59a16650e1fd2a7da092bdba19fb0.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/f7c59a16650e1fd2a7da092bdba19fb0.png)

**OPERATION: EIGHT CLAW**

JUNE 25TH @ 11:30am ET - JULY 16TH @ 11:30pm ET

Duviri is in grave peril, and Dominus Thrax calls for the help of the Drifter. The Lost Island of **Scholar’s Landing** has returned, bringing with it menaces of the Void. Major Neci Rusalka has usurped Thrax’s throne and threatens the reality of Duviri altogether.

  
With the help of Dominus Thrax, venture back to Duviri and fight against new Murmur enemies to reach the depths of the island, but be warned of a deadly inhabitant — Oraxia — who stands in the way of your shot at holding back the Indifference.

**What You Need to Know**

**Prerequisite:** The Hex Quest must be completed to access the Operation in the Isleweaver node.

[47a67ac7069ac3171b29a28d460934df.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/47a67ac7069ac3171b29a28d460934df.png)

After players complete **The Hex Quest,** the **Isleweaver node** will appear in Duviri’s Navigation, where Operation: Eight Claw takes place. After Operation: Eight Claw has concluded, the Isleweaver node will remain accessible from Duviri’s Navigation. 

While Operation: Eight Claw is live, players can earn a special resource called **Dominus Aureus** while fighting in Scholar’s Landing, which is used to trade with Dominus Thrax for Operation specific rewards (more on that in the Rewards section).   


**What You Need to Do**

Players will start in the familiar cave of Duviri but with a visitor — Dominus Thrax himself! To expedite the swift removal of Rusalka from the Kingdom of Duviri, Thrax is allowing you use of your Warframes in Duviri without restriction! Pick your loadout for the fight ahead and head through the portal.

You will face a pre-selected set of objectives to progress through the island, including a faceoff with Oraxia. The objective types are randomized per run, but each will include a fight with Oraxia as the 5th to complete, and a final showdown with a familiar Murmur boss.   


  1. Duviri Objective
  2. Duviri Objective or Undercroft
  3. Duviri Objective or Undercroft
  4. Duviri Objective or Undercroft
  5. Oraxia’s Lair
  6. Duviri Objective or Undercroft
  7. Summon The Fragmented



Unlike the main island in The Duviri Experience, you will not have access to side objectives.

Once you complete all of the objectives, you will be presented with a chest to claim your reward of 18-22 **Dominus Aureus**! (22-26 Dominus Aureus on Steel Path).  


**Community Progress**

Operation: Eight Claw comes with a Community Progress segment, **tracking the total Dominus Aureus****spent****by players.**

As the total number spent ticks up, progress is made towards unlocking the three variants of the **Invictus Signa.**

[5fc2ff2f887f318df0c6388504e1a38b.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/5fc2ff2f887f318df0c6388504e1a38b.png)

Once a Signa has been unlocked, it becomes available for purchase from Dominus Thrax in the Dormizone.

  * **Invictus Signa** unlocks at 30% community progress
  * **Invictus Emergent Signa** unlocks at 60% community progress
  * **Invictus Apex Signa** (pictured above) unlocks at 90% community progress



Community progress can be tracked in the Event tab in Navigation!   


**Rewards**

While Rusalka hoards the throne, Dominus Thrax has taken refuge in the Dormizone (located to the immediate right once you pass the kitchen doors). As you fight towards reclaiming Scholar’s Landing, you can collect a variety of offerings from Thrax himself. He also offers rewards from previous Operations!

Spend your Dominus Aureus on:

  * NEW: Invictus Signas - there are three variants that unlock with community progress: 
    * Invictus Signa (30% community progress)

Note: Compared to previous Operations, we have removed Common Arcanes from this redemption store. We have also reduced the number of purchasable Arcanes from 42 of each Arcane to 21 (essentially, one full Arcane instead of two full Arcanes).

After Operation: Eight Claw has ended on July 16th @ 11:30 AM ET, Dominus Thrax will stick around until July 23rd and continue to sell his wares. After July 23rd, he will leave the Dormizone, taking his Operation-exclusive rewards with him. Acrithis, in her usual spot in the Dormizone, will remain as the permanent vendor for Scuttler Husks. Learn more about Scuttler Husks in the “New Resources” section above.   


**Clan Trophies**

During Operation: Eight Claw, the spending of Dominus Aureus will also contribute to your Clan goal. Completing goals will earn your Clan an **Eight Claw Trophy** of various tiers. Like previous Operations, Clan Trophies are available in Terracotta, Bronze, Silver, Gold.

The amount of Dominus Aureus to spend to unlock each tier is as follows:

[44228839a0e964c6200f200a7ba40081.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/44228839a0e964c6200f200a7ba40081.png)

As usual, lowering your Clan tier is disabled now until the Operation concludes. 

Share your Feedback & Bug Reports on Operation Eight Claw in the [dedicated Feedback Subforum](https://forums.warframe.com/forum/2101-operation-eight-claw-feedback/). 

Once Operation: Eight Claw has concluded, the Isleweaver node will remain intact in Duviri’s Navigation so players may return for Scuttler Husks, Pathos Clamps, Oraxia’s Blueprints and more. Read on to learn more!

**Oraxia’s Prex Card**

A story straight out of Duviri, of course Oraxia has a Prex Card! I’m sure if you search Scholar’s Landing in the Isleweaver node you’ll be able to find it eventually. It’s a miracle it isn’t covered in cobwebs…

[d2454c556c9941f9bdd2061fcebb2789.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/d2454c556c9941f9bdd2061fcebb2789.png)

**VALKYR REWORK**

A berserker’s fury fills the air. Corpus, Grineer, Infested: torn pare by pare. Intrepid claws, raw and wild, writhing countless foes, until naught that’s left is the silence following their deathly throes. This is Valkyr’s rework, and it's here now! 

Valkyr’s rework focuses on her core identity: the rage of a berserker. She’s receiving a top-to-bottom ability refresh, including an updated Passive that leans into a new mechanic: Rage. With this, we intend to capture the essence of reckless commitment. No breaks allowed. 

To assist players in revisiting their Valkyr builds following these changes, an Inbox message containing 1 Forma (built) will be sent to all players with Isleweaver’s release!  


**Valkyr Stat Changes**

Firstly, Valkyr’s base Health and Armor stats are being increased to provide her with over double the effective Health points. The stats below are at base value.

  * Valkyr Health: 650 from 270
  * Valkyr Armor: 855 from 630
  * Valkyr Prime Health: 650 from 270
  * Valkyr Prime Armor: 1000 from 735  




**Passive**

Valkyr accumulates Rage when killing enemies, increasing her Melee Damage up to 300%. She consumes her Rage (if above 150% in the Rage meter) to prevent death and become invulnerable briefly.

  * Gain Rage on Melee Kill and Melee Hit. Gain up to 300% Melee Damage based on real-time (i.e., no ‘snapshotting’) Rage amount.
    * Kills grant a small amount of Rage.
      * Assists build Rage—i.e., if Valkyr has Melee struck an enemy, but the kill is secured by another player, Valkyr will earn Rage.
    * Finisher Kills and Mercy Kills grant a larger amount of Rage.
    * Melee hits grant the least amount of Rage, but can be triggered multiple times per enemy.
    * Rage stops decaying briefly whenever you gain Rage.
      * Rage % slowly decays over time without Rage generation.
  * Consumes all Rage when dealt lethal damage if the Rage meter is at 150% or above, preventing death and giving Valkyr 5 seconds of invulnerability.
    * Death prevention has no cooldown; simply return to above 150% in the Rage meter to be able to prevent death again!  




**Rip Line**

Rip Line has received adjustments to better accommodate playstyles that seek fast-paced traversal options, alongside increased flexibility in ability cancellation and further enemy grouping capabilities. 

  * Rip Line no longer cancels until Valkyr reaches the end of the line.
  * Rip Line’s speed and ease-of-use have been updated, with the goal of providing a smoother experience.
  * Double Jump usage is reset upon using Rip Line.
    * Rip Line can be cancelled by jumping (or pressing melee) during use.
    * Jumping during Rip Line adds a small, temporary momentum boost to the player’s movement mid-air.
  * Rip Line’s cast when targeting an enemy will pull Valkyr towards that enemy and group enemies within a 9m radius around her upon reaching her target.
    * Valkyr will automatically use a Melee attack when arriving at her target.
    * The radius for Rip Line’s grouping scales with Ability Range.
  * Updated Rip Line’s cast and impact SFX. 



**Augment**

  * **Swing Line:** Rip Lines has no Energy cost while Airborne. +20% Parkour Velocity.  




**Warcry**

Warcry is receiving only minor adjustments, as the ability already fits the bill in her reworked kit. However, Warcry will now be able to buff allies who lose her Warcry buff, alongside additional quality of life tuning!

  * Warcry can now be recast.
  * Warcry’s base duration increased to 20 seconds from 15 seconds.
  * Ability effects spread to allies within Affinity Range (50m, previously 25m)
    * Players can re-acquire Warcry’s effects when re-entering Valkyr’s Affinity Range. If you die or get nullified, you can return to Valkyr to refresh Warcry!
  * Warcry no longer slows enemies—it’s been moved to Paralysis!
  * Warcry has received a new casting animation and updated visual effects.
  * Warcry can now be cast while moving.  




**Paralysis**

Paralysis now brings additional functionality to double down on the ability to weaken your foes, while reconfiguring it from costing Shields to Energy.

  * Enemies struck by Paralysis receive a base 50% Melee Damage Vulnerability.
    * Melee Damage Vulnerability scales with Ability Strength.
    * Enemies and enemy health bars will receive VFX to indicate their vulnerability when the player actively uses any Melee weapon.
  * Enemies struck by Paralysis are slowed by a base 30%.
    * The slow scales with Ability Strength.
  * Shield cost has been removed. Casting Paralysis now costs 25 Energy.
    * Since there’s no Shield cost anymore, a base 400 Impact Damage was added to compensate.
  * Paralysis has been updated with an upper-body animation to ensure movement isn’t interrupted when casting.
  * Paralysis’s VFX was updated to appear radial rather than conal.
    * Paralysis’s previous line of sight check has been updated to our modern version to improve hit-detection reliability.



**Augments:**

  * **Prolonged Paralysis:** Enemies will now be ragdolled when grouped up via the Augment. 
    * This will fix a long-standing issue where enemies would not be pulled while afflicted with Status Effect reaction animations (e.g. Heat or Electric Status Effects).  




**Hysteria**

The staple of her kit, Hysteria, pulls together the fantasy of her berserker theme. Now, combined with her new Passive, Hysteria will utilize her Rage to deliver hysterical destruction to any foe in your path.

  * Hysteria’s Invulnerability has been removed, as Valkyr now triggers invulnerability through her Passive.
    * With this change, the Self-Reflection damage part of Hysteria has been completely removed. In other words, you can no longer die specifically from deactivating Hysteria while enemies are nearby. 
  * Armor gained from Warcry is increased by 3x during Hysteria for Valkyr.
    * Currently, Valkyr has one of the highest Armor stats, with room to acquire much more, but that Armor became meaningless with Hysteria’s invulnerability. Here, we aim to amplify Valkyr’s Armor capabilities, combined with her death prevention while above 50% of the Rage meter and Life Steal improvements.
  * Valkyr is immune to Status Effects while Hysteria is active.
  * Energy Drain caps at 5 Energy per second instead of 15.
  * Healing from Hysteria’s Life Steal is now 100 Health per hit.
    * Health gained scales with Ability Strength.
  * Updated Hysteria’s SFX. 



Valkyr’s Talons/Hysteria Melee Stance has received various adjustments to accommodate improved mobility, damage and forced Status Effects on her attacks during Hysteria.

  * Combo attacks and animations have been updated to remove sudden stops, ensuring mobility is maintained while attacking (e.g., the Fervor Combo no longer stops player movement on the 3rd and 4th hits).
  * Guaranteed Slash Status Effects have been added to several attacks in her Combos (excluding her Slide Attack).
    * The Combos receiving Slash Status Effects during certain attacks are:
      * Fervor (Neutral Combo)
      * Rage (Forward Combo)
      * Delirium (Neutral Block Combo)
      * Rise From Ashes (Heavy Attack Combo)
  * Several Combos have received increased Combo Counter gain on attacks:
    * Fervor (Neutral Combo)
      * Old: 1/1/1/1/1/1
      * New: 1/1/2/2/2/3
    * Delirium (Neutral Block Combo)
      * Old: 1/1/1/1
      * New: 1/1/2/2
    * Rage (Forward Combo)
      * Old: 1/1/1/1
      * New: 2/3/3/3
    * Madness (Forward Blocking Combo)
      * Old: 1/1/1/1/1/1
      * New: 2/2/2/2/3/3
  * Several damage multipliers in her Combos increased up to 300%.
  * Hysteria’s attacks received an increased base Attack Range to 2.15m from 1.7m.
  * Hysteria IPS is now only Slash (75%) and Puncture (25%)—Impact damage and weighting have been removed entirely.
    * Impact felt less useful in Hysteria’s damage distribution, as our goal was to emphasize the essence of Valkyr’s damage-dealing destructive capabilities.



**Augments:**

  * **Enraged:** Damage and Critical Chance are increased to 350% from 200%.
  * **Hysterical Assault:** Attack with Valkyr’s Talons to leap onto targeted enemies up to 50m away. Gain +50% Parkour Velocity and +50% Sprint Speed for 5s.

2025-04-19 08:46:42,"Islam is false (from an ex-muslim) The single strongest argument against Islam is probably that there is no strong argument for Islam in the first place.

Other arguments would be :

**1. Selling modesty in dunya, only to sell a hedonist paradise:**

Not trying to be disrespectful here but, the very way jannah is described, ""marble rounded non-saggy breasts"", ""big rounded eyes"", ""see through skin where you can see the bone marrow"" , ""pale-skin"" , hoors will remain virgins even after you have sex with them, etc does not seem to be coming from the God of the entire universe rather seems to be the fetishes of an Arab merchant in the 7th century.

**2. Cultic system:**

No free thought, rational queries allowed. Rational queries are allowed as far as you do not question the pillars of faith. ""Why does Allah always communicate with a Messenger?"", ""Was Muhamad really a prophet"", etc questions that target the core of Islam are full on discouraged.

Stuff like, ""Shaitan is misleading you"", ""Don't ask too many questions just submit"", ""Too much rationalization is bad"", ""Don't speak like a kaffir"" etc are the answers I got since my childhood whenever I had such questions. And why not? All these are answers Muhammad himself came up with when he could not answer stuff. And always ending the debate with ""Allah knows best ! "". Talk about skipping real queries.

**4. Fear of Allah and burning in hell forever:**

Any queries that doesn't get rational answers -- you are going to hell !! The fear mongering tactic pretty much paints a cultic approach of control.  
Quran is full of phrases like ""fear Allah"", ""he is the most merciful"", ""the disbelievers will burn in hell"".  
No matter what, I am supposed to fear this narcissistic God who made me just to worship him all the time! Like dude wtf ? At points in time, I even cursed myself, when I had questions because I thought if I let all these thoughts occur, than I will definitely roast in hell, cause I am not strong in my faith !!!

**5. The staggering evidence that points towards common ancestry:**

Shared endogenous retroviruses **(ERVs)** irrefutably proves the common ancestry between humans and apes. There are also other evidences from protein synthesis, fossil record, Genetic Homology and Synteny, Pseudogenes, mitochondrial DNA and Y-Chromosome diversity, Allelic Diversity and Population Genetics, Homologous Structures, Embryological Similarities, Molecular Clock Analysis, and I can go on and on with this list, trust me......

It's not a single piece of contested source of evidence. Its a whole lot of observable evidences from a whole lot of different disciplines that point towards a Common Ancestry. And therefore, this thing is uncontested in the field of evolution now.

I have looked into our popular Kent Hovind, and Subboor Ahmed as well who are the favourite anti macro-evolution propagandists on the block. And its laughable at most, cause the people they point at, were uncontested on Common Ancestry itself. Would not waste more time on this topic. Its a dead debate now.

But Allah the all knowing God not knowing about Evolution is Surprising innit!

**6. Permitting sex slavery and legalizing child marriage through a divine stamp:**

This is pretty much from the seerah, Quran and the hadees itself. Child marriages and sex slavery in Islam are permitted through divine commands. I would not go deep down the rabbit hole, to counter all the surface level claims of ""oh slaves were given food to eat and clothes to wear"", ""child marriage is just a product of the old times when lifespan used to be less"", etc bs.

I would just like to point out that, according to all the four schools of Islamic Jurisprudence in Sunni Islam, child marriages are legal, (check the age of marriage in Iran), and sex slavery was not stopped until US President John F Kennedy forced the Sauds. There is very well documented evidence to show all the above and to also show that sex slavery was rampant during the Caliphates, and there used to be markets where slaves were sold and bought.

Mind you, there was no one who took the initiative to stop this. It took a kaffir, a non muslim to forcefully stop this sick practice from outside.

All the sickos who justify this, just answer, if you are okay with the Chinese who literally treat the Uighurs the same way. Uighur Females complain of forced sexual harassments and several reports of human trafficking come up. If you are against that, it means you are okay with slavery and all only when the muslim is the one owning the slaves and not the other way round.

**7. Reading Qur'an literally gives u many scientific errors:**

The myths of 7 heavens and 7 earths, Throne of Allah, Mountains as pegs to stop earthquakes, Invisible pillars holding up the sky, Sun and moon chasing each other in the night sky, The sky being a blanket with stars being the decorations, Sun is a big lamp .... Etc , all these are just retwisted narratives from pre islamic beliefs.

All of these can be traced back to the other comparative mythologies. Modern muslims put these under the rugs by saying metaphorical and poetic. But the early islamic scholars like ibn katheer, jalalayn and others believed in a geo centric flat earth. And it was a popular belief amongst many muslims until the Islamic scholars came across the Renaissance and the Greek studies which proved irrefutably in a heliocentric round earth model after which they had to backtrack and call the earlier commentaries as wrong and rephrase the verses as ""metaphorical and poetic"".

You cannot just throw this under the rug ! Early muslims extensively believed the earth was flat.

**8. All scientific miracles or so claimed from the Qur'an are false or just already known knowledge :**

These are actually scientific errors or just basic knowledge that existed before. The embryology from the Qur'an was the biggest miracle considered which was later debunked. All the miracles from the Qur'an are just vague phrases worded together which the typical muslim cherry-picks the way they like in order to suit their agenda.  
Other people around the dawah block now do not make the scientific miracles claim as much as they did in the past, cause they know they would be busted, and rather say we should not try to find such things in the Quran as it is not a scientific book.

**9. Next we come to prophecies of Muhammad:**

Similar cases here. Stuff seems to be unfalsifiable and just vague. Stuff that later got proven like Constantinople, are like cherries that fit into the basket. What about hearing ""end times are near"" for about 1400 years! Oh let me guess! ""Here 'near' means different. We do not know when the end times will come. Allah knows best !! ""

The twisting around they have to do just to make fit a single prophecy is crazy! All the prophecies from the Pharoah, to tall building competition, to fall of Constantinople, are just bad. The Simpsons have a better record with such prophecies to be honest!

**10. The inimitability claim is a complete farce ! :**

AI creates better poetic stuff than Qur'an. The metrics are subjective as hell.  
I have tried to make sense of this argument the most. I have binge watched ""Farid Response"" and other dawah channels which talk about this claim and cutting to the chase it is subjective as hell.

However, for a child indoctrinated in a Muslim environment, the Quran's perceived supremacy is an inevitable outcome of psychological conditioning, not evidence of objective merit. Raised to view the text as divine, with its recitation reinforced through ritual and social pressure, such a child is primed to dismiss any competing work as inferior, regardless of quality. This bias, rooted in emotional attachment and dogmatic education, exposes the inimitability claim as a subjective cultural artifact, not a universal truth, as it relies on suppressing critical evaluation and exalting familiarity over merit.

Plus why would anyone try to recreate something like the Quran when any such act would have him getting death threats, as it would amount to challenging Allah, the supreme God.

As a Machine Learning Engineer myself, I can use LLMs at hand to create much much better stuff than the Quran in all clarity, complexity, and adaptability, producing poetry, prose, or philosophical treatises tailored to any style or language with remarkable fluency. But who is there to lay down all the rules and represent all the 2 billion muslims ?

The book of Mormon and the Hindu Vedas claim inimitability too. This is one of the worst arguments for Islam I have come across, but whatever had to address this one.

**11. The preservation of the Qur'an letter to letter is false**

Qur'an is not preserved letter to letter.

The Sana'a Manuscript, discovered in Yemen in 1972, is a critical piece of evidence: its lower text (a palimpsest) from the mid-7th century reveals deviations from the standard Uthmanic Qur'an, including word omissions, substitutions, and variant readings (e.g., in Surah 2:196-198).  
Secular scholars like Gerd R. Puin and Asma Hilali note these discrepancies suggest an evolving text, not a fixed one. Other early manuscripts, such as the Birmingham Folios (c. 568-645 CE), show orthographic variations due to the Arabic script’s initial lack of diacritical marks and vowels, leading to multiple possible readings (e.g., *hanif* vs. *hunafa*). The Uthmanic standardization itself, as recorded in hadiths (Sahih al-Bukhari 6.61.510), involved destroying variant codices, implying pre-existing diversity in recitation and transcription. Even later manuscripts, like the Topkapi Codex (8th century), contain minor orthographic and consonantal differences. Secular scholars, including François Déroche, argue that the Qur'an’s oral tradition allowed for flexibility in early transmission, with the rasm (consonantal skeleton) stabilized only gradually.

Compared to the Bible, the Qur'an’s textual tradition is more uniform, but this is **largely due to centralized control under Uthman and a shorter canonization period**, not divine preservation. The claim of letter-for-letter fidelity ignores the historical reality of scribal errors, regional recitations (e.g., the seven *ahruf*), and the script’s evolution, making it a dogmatic assertion rather than a fact grounded in manuscript evidence.

The best evidence for letter-to-letter preservation will be a complete, dated top to bottom autograph manuscript, corroborated by multiple identical early copies, contemporary standardization records, an unbroken transmission chain, and no variants. Than it would be a irrefutable evidence For the Qur'an being preserved letter to letter. But no such evidence exists.

Do not bring a single Manuscript parchment and claim ""hey its preserved letter to letter !!"". That is less science and more a big leap of faith at best.

**12. The supernatural stuff:**

Angels, jinns, shaitan, dajjal the one eyed monster, sun prostating towards Allah, walking stones, talking birds and ants, trees exposing where the jews are hiding etc point at some old folklore re-organized as a faith rather than the absolute truth. There are hadees about shaitan urinating in your ears, Shaitan Laughing at Yawning, Coughing, or Sneezing etc. How can anyone come to believe them in their sane mind ?

I can go on with this list, but these are enough. When u add all of these together, u can just say Islam is just another religion just like all the tens of thousands other that existed in human history. I will stop here. It's enough. There is no need to bash something which has little evidence in the first place.

2020-11-09 20:42:35,"The Trump Campaign's Accusations of Voter Fraud: An Exhaustive Analysis and Fact Check Full disclosure: I'm not a Trump fan in the slightest. I don't spend an extraordinary amount of time talking about that fact on Reddit; but some of my comments do indeed express this view, either by way of serious commentary or lighthearted joking. 

At the same time, I take impartial analysis and fact checking *extremely* seriously. I always push back against weak and/or unfounded accusations that are made against Trump, as I do for all other political figures — something I've done both on this account and on /u/FactCheckHuman, my dedicated fact checking account.

Usually, my fact checks don't run much more than a couple of paragraphs. In some instances, though, I've done ultra–deep dives into an issue. This current post can certainly be considered one of these. As with any other fact check, the ultimate aim of these write-ups is simply to determine what is or isn't true; or what is or isn't *likely* to be true. 

At the same time, this post also genuinely intends to persuade people of the speciousness and toxicity of the Trump campaign's current claims about voter fraud. To tell the truth, I kind of approached it as a synthesis of conversations I've been having with my conservative friends and family members, who are really on board with the Trump position on election integrity.

____

In any case, not everything is as simple as finding the facts and evidence, and letting these speak for themselves. Ideally that's how we want things to be; but often times there are a number of ambiguities that prevent this from being done so easily, in terms of varying interpretations that the evidence permits. In these instances, we basically have to make a reasonable judgment call about what's *likely* to be the case: educated guesses that try to fill in some of the gaps in the evidence.

Even here, though, I try to be similarly rigorous, and take a lead from what I call **critical parsimony**. In short, this tries to find the most ""normal"" and least sensational/conspiratorial explanation for something, while also bearing in mind some of the complexities and anomalies that might complicate the issue. Often times, these two different or seemingly contradictory aspects come together when we encounter some event or phenomenon that superficially seems exceptional and counterintuitive, but which turns out to be much less unusual than it appears to be. In short, this allows extraordinary events to be, well, rare.

In line with that last point, one of the most insightful things we can look at is events and situations, usually from the recent past, which can help contextualize and elucidate various things that have taken place in the current election — and things which have taken place in terms of people's *reaction* to this. So things like looking back to the 2016 or 2012 election can be crucial here, or other historical events that can give precedent for what's happening in 2020, and shed light on it.

___

I suppose the most obvious point of departure for this post is what we might describe as a main ""narrative"" that Donald Trump and the Trump campaign and its supporters have advanced in response to the election itself: that the election has been unusually fraught with irregularities and duplicitous/fraudulent intentions. Responsibility for these irregularities have almost always been placed at the feet of Democrats, and is clearly taken to represent an effort on Democrats' part to steal the election.

Obviously, I think a lot of Trump supporters and conservatives have accepted this narrative more or less at face value. Even before getting into some of the actual specifics of the claims of voter fraud, though, one thing that I've called attention to from the outset is how we might first consider the initial motivations behind the narrative itself a bit more critically, and how it comes together in the first place. 

Not to get too philosophical or anything, but it's worth pointing out that whenever we have a political ""narrative"" like this, it's somewhat of an artificial construct. A bunch of different phenomena or allegations are brought together and crammed into one explanatory framework. Nuance or ambiguity becomes something secondary to *promoting* the narrative. Far too often, the cast is full of stereotyped protagonists and antagonists, divided along party lines.

Further, it's important not to lose sight of everything that's paved the way for such a bitter partisan narrative to emerge in the first place. The electoral process itself probably never been neutral affair, and is still intensely partisan in numerous aspects — from the emergence of the Electoral College itself, to the crafting and enforcing of state voting laws and guidelines. At lower levels, issues of gerrymandering have been a serious problem; and at all levels, different political parties have fought in the courts to try to influence voter eligibility and voter turnout in their own favor. 

In tandem with this, beyond the judiciary itself, political parties also wage many of these same battles in the court of public opinion.

In this current instance, the overarching narrative in question — of Democrat attempts to unlawfully steal the election — indeed seems to target public opinion above all else. And it far predates the 2020 election itself, too. Even before running in 2015, Trump had previously [suggested](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/402379878643040256) that President Obama's original election was assisted by fraudulent votes being cast by dead voters. During the 2016 Iowa caucus, Trump [accused](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-cruz/trump-accuses-cruz-of-stealing-iowa-caucuses-through-fraud-idUSMTZSAPEC23ZBL9YS) Ted Cruz and his campaign of having committed fraud, and called for a ""new election"" or that the results be nullified; and he leveled a similar [accusation](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/708715781199044609) against Marco Rubio in the Florida primary, too. 

In August of 2016, regarding the general election, Trump [claimed](https://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-cheating-cheat-voter-id-fraud-system-rigged) that ""[t]he only way we can lose . . . Pennsylvania . . . is if cheating goes on."" He continued to frequent challenge the integrity of the election leading up to November; and even after his victory, he [stated](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/802972944532209664) that he ""won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally"" — implying there had been upwards of 3 million ""illegal"" votes. Very closely echoing what we'd see in 2020, after the 2018 Florida Senatorial election, Trump [stated](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1061962869376540672) that ""[t]he Florida Election should be called in favor of Rick Scott and Ron DeSantis in that large numbers of new ballots showed up out of nowhere, and many ballots are missing or forged. An honest vote count is no longer possible-ballots massively infected. Must go with Election Night!""

In May and June 2020, Trump [began](https://www.factcheck.org/2020/06/trumps-shaky-warning-about-counterfeit-mail-in-ballots/) ramping up claims that fraudulent mail-in ballots would be printed in vast droves, both by domestic entities and ""maybe by the millions by foreign powers."" Again, this would be insisted on time and time again; and finally, echoing his sentiments in late November 2016, on November 7 Trump [declared](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325099845045071873) that ""I WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!"", and later [reiterating](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325195021339987969) that he received 71,000,000 ""legal"" votes. (An exhaustive catalogue of Trump's allegations re: voter fraud can be found [here](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/11/05/president-trumps-false-claims-vote-fraud-chronology/).)

It's hard to deny that Trump's public-facing view has always proposed voter fraud and irregularities as ubiquitous things affecting a large number of elections. But it's precisely the one-sidedness of his seeing monsters in every shadow here that points toward another explanation. Trump's accusatory or even paranoid worldview can be seen as something like a microcosm reflecting a much wider trend in historical political rhetoric around elections.

Even when Trump is taken out of the picture altogether, the propagandistic function of allegations of election fraud has still been frequently noted by a number of scholars and historians who specialize in election studies. In a 2007 [paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1647224) for the Brennan Center for Justice at the NYU School of Law, for example, American constitutional law scholar Justin Levitt calls attention to the emotional resonance that claims of voter fraud can elicit — and also notes its prevalence because of this:

>**Allegations of election-related fraud make for enticing press. Voter fraud, in particular, has the feel of a bank heist caper: roundly condemned but technically fascinating, and sufficiently lurid to grab and hold headlines. Perhaps because these stories are dramatic, voter fraud makes a popular scapegoat. In the aftermath of a close election, losing candidates are often quick to blame voter fraud for the results, and legislators cite voter fraud as justification for various new restrictions on the exercise of the franchise.** (""The Truth About Voter Fraud,"" abstract)

Similarly, Raymond Gastil, writing in an [article](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02716904) in the journal *Studies In Comparative International Development* in 1990, noted that

>in many new or transitional countries, it is standard practice for the opposition to point out before the election how the government will ""steal"" the election. If the opposition loses, it will then make strenuous claims that the election was stolen. Thus the ARENA party in El Salvador has claimed fraud in each of the several elections in the 1980s; most recently it won the election and yet claimed that it was robbed of the greater win to which it was entitled. Claims and counterclaims of this nature are seldom subject to verification, even for those on the ground.

Although the U.S. obviously isn't a new or transitional country, it's impossible not to see close parallels to the accusations of Trump here — especially the similarity between the claim of having been ""robbed of the greater win to which it was entitled"" and Trump sweetening his electoral win by insisting that he won the popular vote, too, so long as ""illegal"" votes are deducted from the tally. 

But when these claims *are* put to the test, in actuality, scholarly studies have long demonstrated that the prevalence of true voter fraud in general in U.S. elections is minuscule. A Brennan Center for Justice [special report](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/analysis/Briefing_Memo_Debunking_Voter_Fraud_Myth.pdf) on voter fraud compiles and links to many if not most major studies on voter fraud in the U.S., concluding that together these studies paint a clear picture that voter fraud ""very rarely happens."" (See also my **Endnote** for more on this.)

So, statistics paints a much different picture than political rhetoric would have us believe. 

If the bogeyman here is more of a phantasm than anything, however, it's still a powerful tool for influencing electorates: ""voter fraud and voter suppression allegations are strongly used as a mobilization tool by parties during significant elections (Hasen, 2012; Levitt, 2007)."" (This quote is taken from Fogarty, Kimball and Kosnik's article ""[The Media, Voter Fraud, and the U.S. 2012 Elections](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17457289.2019.1711383?journalCode=fbep20),"" published in the *Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties*. This article is especially worth reading to get a bit more background about some of the things that set the stage for the 2016 and 2020 elections and their rhetoric.)

One last thing: Population growth and other factors have led to a vastly increased number of voters over the past couple of decades. In 2000, just a little over 100 million people voted, while in the current election this number went up to 130 million. Further, the transition to electronic voting and the use of tabulating machines has increased significantly during this time, too.

Because of these things — all further complicated by COVID this year — both statistics and common wisdom alone should lead us to expect a large number of voting irregularities. But it's also important not to conflate irregularities with voter fraud. Irregularities are simply errors, that don't necessarily require bad human intentions at all. However, with realpolitik at its ugly peak in the election cycle, this offers an opportunity for political pundits to read deliberate ill intentions *into* these incidents, whether by innuendo or explicit accusation. But it should also be kept in mind that if irregularities are unintentional, and if political affiliation in the U.S. is split roughly equally, then these irregularities should also affect the two political parties roughly equally; probably in similar proportions. 

Finally, the increasing partisan divide between media outlets, along with their selective coverage, probably makes it easy to overlook (or perhaps forget) the great number of lawsuits routinely filed by *both* Democratic and Republican attorneys, both in the lead-up to the election and in the wake of its inevitable irregularities: efforts to block or secure votes from voting populations likely to favor one or the other of the two parties. It should be clear here, then, that an overemphasis on irregularities and claims and fraud are often treated as rhetorical and legal tools in service of political self-interests.

With all these things considered — and again, even if we set the political situation in 2020 aside, along with some of the specific claims of voter fraud that are currently being made — this should still give us ample reason to rethink how accusations of voter fraud *function* more broadly: what's in it for those making these accusations, politically speaking; how these claimants often see little use for factual accuracy or measured analysis here; and how this perpetuates toxic discourse and bad-faith assumptions.

**Claims of Election Irregularities and Fraud in 2020: A Catalogue and Commentary**

So this second part of the post is going to be a sort of compendium of a lot of the major allegations of voting irregularities and voter fraud that have been circulating, followed by a critical analysis of these. While some of these irregularities are clearly broad and would affect both political parties, I'm pretty sure that almost every one of these claims has circulated widely in conservative and/or pro-Trump sources; and most have been interpreted as a partisan attack on election integrity. I'm sure that there have been other incidents or alleged incidents that have circulated on the left; but this post is already extremely long and took quite a while to write, and I don't want to make more work for myself.

I'll probably be updating this in the days to come, as more info on various things comes out.

Finally, as a sort of transition point between my probably-far-too-long prologue and the catalogue, I think it can be very instructive to take a look at a compendium of [voting irregularities in 2016](https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/election-2016-tracking-reports-voting-problems-across-united-states-n673236) — to help get some additional context and perspective for how similar issues can and did surface in the 2020 election.

**Claim**: It's suspicious how additional Biden votes have kept magically appearing, long after election day, pushing his total over Trump's prior total. 

**Response**: I've put this in the initial position because it seems to be one of the most [common](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PGfBYsqav2A) observations of accusations: it was one of the first that Trump [made](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1324007806694023169), and which he continued to [repeat](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1324901123996741634). But among all the different accusations here, this has one of the most mundane explanations. 

Prior to the election itself, and noting various state laws pertaining to the tabulation of mail-in votes, various commentators called attention to a likely phenomenon of delayed results for mail-in ballots — which have skewed heavily Democrat. Dave Wassermann [noted](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/beware-blue-mirage-red-mirage-election-night-n1245925), for example, that

>in northern battlegrounds such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin . . . officials are not permitted to begin processing mail ballots until the day of the election (or, in Michigan's case, the day before). In those states, a ""red mirage"" of Trump-heavy Election Day votes could linger until larger metro counties report huge tranches of early ballots later in the evening.

(As for mail-in votes skewing highly Democrat, this also has mundane explanations. For reasons that are less than clear, on numerous occasions Trump strongly discouraged his supporters from voting by mail. Unfortunately I don't have the room to fully get into this, though there's certainly some interesting/surprising data about just how overwhelmingly blue mail-in voting skewed even in a number of red strongholds.)

Further, sometimes this claim has appeared in the bit more specific iteration, suggesting that it wasn't just suspicious how Biden votes kept coming in to counteract Trump's tally, but also how *precisely* Biden's total crept past Trump — as if it was known exactly how many votes Biden needed to just barely scrape past him. But this also has a deceptively simple explanation: the extremely slim margin of victory for Biden in states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania basically mirrored the same ultra-slim margin of victory for Trump in these same states in 2016, but now just the other way around. Honing in on PA, for example, we can also see how Biden just marginally outperformed Clinton in terms of [cutting into](https://i.imgur.com/Y3wcNol.png) Trump's lead in many red areas.

Even the [2016 election in Georgia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election_in_Georgia) saw a significant blue shift, especially in the Atlanta metropolitan area — which presaged Biden's performance in 2020, also bolstered by the efforts of those like Stacey Abrams to register an enormous number of new GA voters.

_____

**Claim**: Some counties saw a suspicious or even impossible ratio of votes for Biden. 

**Response**: The most widespread claim of this pertained to Michigan returns as posted by Decision Desk HQ (DDHQ) in the early morning of November 4. A [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/OZAXL5V.png) of the returns at two different times here appeared to show the DDHQ vote tally for Biden go up by 128,000 votes from the previous update, but with no change at all to Trump's total. 

Later that morning, it was [clear](https://twitter.com/ariehkovler/status/1324035122816012291) what had happened: shortly after the original entry error (in Shiawassee County), DDHQ had *subtracted* the erroneous inflated vote update for Biden — something that obviously required no alteration of the tally for Trump. However, the screenshot that circulated gave the misleading impression that it was an *addition* of Biden votes, instead of a subtraction. (My original detailed explanation of this can be seen on /u/FactCheckHuman/.)

A similar claim has been made around the same time in the Wisconsin totals. Here a [chart](https://i.imgur.com/hDF8e1Z.png) is linked, and it's suggested that there was a huge vertical surge of votes for Biden in the hour or so before 6:00 am, but with no change at all in Trump votes. But the explanation here is almost goofy in its simplicity: as seen at other points in the chart, the blue Biden line actually covers the red Trump line at various points. The big vertical Biden vote jump in question is almost certainly simply covering up a smaller vertical jump for Trump, and then continues to obscure it until it ends (otherwise we'd be able to see the horizontal trajectory of the red line). I've lost the original source of this, but I had actually saved another [chart](https://i.imgur.com/lbdCq3u.jpg) which shows the same phenomenon of big vertical leaps, only this time with the red Trump line obscuring the blue Biden line. 

____

**Claim**: The significantly lower number of total votes for Democratic Senators compared to Biden votes in individual states is indicative of something sketchy — when compared to the much smaller mismatch between Trump/Senator votes. 

**Response**: Several articles — e.g. ""Swing States Show Biden Votes Suspiciously Far Exceeding Democrat Down-Ticket Votes"" — note that there was a significant difference in the ratio of Trump votes to GOP Senator votes in Michigan and Georgia (nearly an equal number of votes in both), compared with the ratio of Biden votes relative to votes for the Democrat Senator in these states (significantly lower). 

But this seems to be part of a wider trend of Democrats failing to pay a similar interest in down-ballot candidates. In the 2016 Georgia election, the ratio difference was significantly more drastic: 2,089,104 votes for Trump and 2,135,806 for Isakson, versus 1,877,963 for Clinton but only 1,599,726 for Barksdale — some 275,000 fewer votes for Barksdale than for Clinton. In Wisconsin, there were nearly 75,000 more votes for Ron Johnson than Trump, but 20,000 fewer for Russ Feingold. In PA in 2016, there were 20,000 fewer votes for the GOP Senator as for Trump, compared to 60,000 fewer for the Democratic Senate candidate than for Clinton. (Surprisingly, I haven't been able to find any commentary on this phenomenon. If anyone knows any, please direct me to it.)

Presumably having tabulated similar data from the other states, Trump attorney Sidney Powell has recently [noted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKXMypeXnAU&app=desktop) that there were 450,000 ballots ""in the key states that miraculously only have a mark for Joe Biden on them and no other candidate."" But based on what I've noted above, I'd be willing to bet that this isn't truly miraculous. Also, as a fascinating fact, in the 2016 election, 1.75 million (!) voters [refrained](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/12/14/1-7-million-people-in-33-states-and-dc-cast-a-ballot-without-voting-in-the-presidential-race/) from voting for a Presidential candidate entirely, *only* voting down-ballot. And frankly, I find it easier to imagine someone only voting for a Presidential candidate, than only voting down-ballot.

____


**Claim**: There have been over 3,000 instances of voter fraud in Nevada, with non-NV residents voting in the NV election. 

**Response**: According to the official Nevada Secretary of State [site](https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/elections/election-information/2020-election/2020-general-election), ""Nevada residents who are students in another state or are otherwise temporarily residing in another state may vote in the 2020 Nevada general election."" Similarly, apparently a look at the [complete list](https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20402413-nv-moved-voters) of 3,000+ voters here turns up a number of overseas military personnel; though when I took a look at that, I didn't really see many. Even further, a [fact check](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/06/nevada-republican-party/fact-checking-republican-claim-illegal-votes-nevad/) of this same claim by PolitiFact also notes that ""[p]eople who move within 30 days before an election can cast a vote in their new state, or in their prior state of residence, in-person or via absentee ballot."" (In this regard, one of the statements by former Nevada Attorney General Adam Laxalt may also be of interest, which was a bit more specific in noting that ""[w]e are also certain there are thousands of people whose votes have been counted *who have moved out of Clark County during the pandemic*"" — emphasis mine.)

Finally, perhaps also worth noting is that there are actually [allegations](https://www.salon.com/2020/11/06/trump-campaign-lawyers-may-have-violated-privacy-act-and-usps-rules-in-nevada-voter-fraud-lawsuit/) of irregularities in the attainment of information in the first place — at least in the version of the criminal referral to AG William Barr that Trump campaign spokesperson Tim Murtaugh [submitted](https://twitter.com/TimMurtaugh/status/1324564674076168194).

**Claim**: The votes of those in Arizona who filled out a ballot by hand using a Sharpie were/would be invalidated. 

**Response**: Various Arizona county officials have disputed that this would automatically invalidate a vote. That being said, there are indeed [reports](https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/verified-complaint-with-attachments.pdf) of tabulating machines rejecting votes after voters used Sharpies and noted a bleed-through of the ink. This finds some additional support from the official Pima County Twitter, where it was [written](https://twitter.com/pimaarizona/status/1324031397971914752) that ""[f]elt pens are discouraged because the ink can bleed through."" However, [another source](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/05/sharpie-ballots-trump-strategy-arizona-434372) states that

>According to a video Maricopa County published on Oct. 24, Sharpies — at home and at the ballot box — are compatible with their scanners, and were actually the best choice for filling out ballots, due to their fast-drying ink. 

**Claim** Some of the votes of those in Maricopa County, Arizona were rejected due to stray marks or (possibly) ink bleed-through; yet some poll workers seemed unable to help voters remedy this and cast a valid vote, due to their own confusion about how the tabulating machines worked. 

**Response**: This is the subject of a [lawsuit](https://cdn.donaldjtrump.com/public-files/press_assets/verified-complaint-with-attachments.pdf) by the Trump campaign and RNC, etc.; and from a cursory read of the complaint, it seems to be well-founded. I have no clue what the remedy for this would be, though.

____


**Claim**: Poll workers have seen brazenly filling out ballots themselves. 

**Response**: Several PolitiFact fact checks ([1](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/06/facebook-posts/pennsylvania-poll-worker-was-copying-information-d/), [2](https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/nov/06/facebook-posts/no-pennsylvania-poll-workers-werent-caught-fraudul/)) have already covered this. In short, it's standard operating procedure for the voting choices of damaged ballots to be transferred/transcribed onto a new, non-damaged ballot. This can even happen on a massive scale, as [this report](https://americanprogress.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/FlVotingReport.pdf) on the 2012 Florida election notes:

>During the election, the county’s ballot printer sent out around 60,000 absentee ballots with a typo that could not be read by the county’s tabulation machines. Because of this mistake, county workers had to copy about 35,000 of the votes by hand onto new ballots.

This also intersects with Arizona's SharpieGate slightly: one [fact check](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/11/04/fact-check-sharpiegate-controversy-arizona-false-claim/6164820002/) re: SharpieGate noted that

>According to the state's [elections procedures manual](https://azsos.gov/sites/default/files/2019_ELECTIONS_PROCEDURES_MANUAL_APPROVED.pdf), if a felt-tip pen mark does bleed through, the ballot will likely get sent for duplication. An election worker will fill out a new ballot using the voter's choices that will be read properly by tabulation machines. 

I'm not sure what measures are in place to ensure that the poll workers don't switch the votes in these instances (besides any poll observers who could see this); but in any case, the ""risk"" of one's vote being switched seems to be equal for Democrat and Republican voters — something that was also [noted](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/arizona/2020/11/05/arizona-attorney-general-mark-brnovich-satisfied-sharpies-answers/6181735002/) by the Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich (Republican).

In any case, as for more on spoiled ballots: a Project Veritas article (which I can't link due to a Reddit-wide ban) claims that its journalists had found 8 to 10 spoiled ballots in Quakertown, PA. I'm mentioning this here because I had been sort of curious what's supposed to be done with spoiled ballots; and apparently, as the article notes, ""Pennsylvania law requires spoiled ballots to be held for 22 months after an election."" I know a 22 months retention for some election materials is indeed found in [federal law](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/broward/fl-sb-broward-elections-supervisor-broke-law-snipes-canova-20180514-story.html), though I haven't seen anything else that specifies what's to be done with spoiled ballots.

____

**Claim(s)**: Donald Trump and others [shared](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1325527391993786374) reports that there had been some sort of unspecified reporting error in a batch of votes in Fulton County, GA. Later it was [stated](https://twitter.com/abc7newsbayarea/status/1325226554209734657) in ambiguous language on ABC7's Twitter account that this reporting error ""has taken @JoeBiden's lead in Georgia from 4,000 votes to 7,000 votes."" This was interpreted by many to mean that the (correction of this) error was actually in Biden's favor. 

**Response**: What actually appears to have happened is that the reporting error pertained to votes *within* the batch that originally had given Biden a 3,000 vote lead — but it wasn't that there were actually 3,000 votes that were mistabulated. The [true number](https://twitter.com/EricUbias/status/1325449568646017024) of affected votes within the batch appears to have been 342; and there's actually no information as to what the Biden/Trump split here was.
____

**Claim**: Glitches in voting machine software should cause things like *crashes*, and not the sort of vote switching that's been reported.

**Response**: Due to the complicated nature of some of the tabulation errors, etc., news reports have sometimes *mistakenly* ascribed these to software glitches — when later, more accurate info comes out which gives other causes. For example, a Detroit Free Press [article](https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/oakland/2020/11/06/oakland-county-election-2020-race-results/6184186002/) originally suggested that the results of a local race in Oakland County, MI had been overturned when it was discovered that a ""computer error"" or ""technical glitch"" had accidentally given votes to the Democratic candidate, and not the Republican one. 

But an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/technology/no-software-glitches-are-not-affecting-vote-counts.html) in the NYTimes from yesterday actually reiterates how this and several other reported errors actually have *human* error as the primary or sole cause here. Re: that local election in Oakland County, it notes that

>County election workers had mistakenly counted votes from the city of Rochester Hills, Mich., twice, according to the Michigan Department of State. The workers later spotted the error.

That being said, it's also not exactly true that things like vote-flipping can only be caused by human error. In the section ""The Challenge of Aging Machines"" in a 2014 Brennan Center [report](https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/americas-voting-machines-risk) on voting machine risks, for example, this discusses instances of vote-flipping that come from calibration errors caused by touch screens that shift and degrade over time. An [NPR article](https://www.npr.org/2016/10/26/499450796/some-machines-are-flipping-votes-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-rigged) from 2016 makes similar observations, while also reporting on how this led to widespread accusations of these votes instead being deliberately ""rigged.""

[Edit:] I figured it was worth it to actually expand this section by looking back at incidents prior to 2020 wherein one candidate's votes were mistakenly given to another (and other related phenomena) in initial tallies — whether this was due to human error, machine error, or sometimes both in conjunction.

It's actually somewhat hard to paint a comprehensive picture of previous Election Night reporting errors like this. Those having never made the news in the first place were probably quickly forgotten. Perhaps there's a trove of early reports of these left to be (re)discovered on Twitter; but this can only take us back so far, considering its fairly recent rise in popularity. However, we can still find records of these in various publications. [This](https://www.cbsnews.com/htdocs/c2k/pdf/REPFINAL.pdf) internal report by CBS News on its Election Night 2000 coverage, discussing the reporting of votes from various FL counties, for examples, notes that

>Vote reports from Volusia County severely understated Gore’s actual total when a faulty computer memory card reported votes that were off by thousands. That precinct, Number 216, *subtracted* more than 16,000 votes from Gore’s total and added votes to Bush’s total. In addition, an apparent reporting error in Brevard County reduced Gore’s total by an additional 4,000 votes.

It also briefly notes other errors, too, such as

>In Massachusetts, 30,000 votes were left uncounted in 51 precincts because of human error. 

>In New Mexico, election officials thought that a handwritten notation about absentee votes from one precinct indicated 120 votes for Gore, when the actual number was 620.

An article in the Denver Post re: the [2016 Colorado primary](https://www.denverpost.com/2016/04/11/colorado-democrats-admit-mistake-that-cost-bernie-sanders-key-delegate/) notes ""a reporting error on caucus night"":

>The problem . . . occurred when a volunteer at Byers Middle School in Denver punched the wrong vote tallies from 10 precincts into the party’s interactive voice response system for the presidential preference poll.

>The state party’s website reported March 1 that Sanders won 14,624 votes, or 54 percent, in Denver County and Clinton took 12,097 votes, or 45 percent.

>But the corrected numbers for Denver County give Sanders 15,194 votes, or 56.5 percent, and Clinton with 11,527, or 43 percent, according to official party results.

A Brennan Center [report](https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2019-08/Report_Voting_Machine_Failures_Database-Solution.pdf) on voting machine failures includes a very long list of human and machine errors in various U.S. elections. Among some of the most significant of those listed include the 2002 Alabama gubernatorial election, where

>The *Birmingham News* and the *New York Times* reported that an error in the way officials downloaded vote data from a computer cartridge led to an incorrect initial tally of votes in the gubernatorial election. The initial tally of the votes showed that the Democratic incumbent had received 19,070 votes in Baldwin County. A reexamination of the vote tallies showed that the incumbent received only 12,736 votes, which gave the victory to his Republican challenger.

Further, in the 2004 Presidential and congressional elections,

>local officials discovered an error in eight Diebold scanners that had been used on 208,446 absentee ballots. According to the *North County Times*, votes were miscounted in both the Democratic presidential primary race and the primary race for the Republican U.S. Senate seat. A recount was conducted, revealing that “2,821 absentee ballots cast for Democratic presidential hopeful John Kerry were actually counted for Dick Gephardt.” Similarly, in the Senate race, 68 votes for one candidate and six votes for another were credited to a third candidate. The *Union Tribune* reported that multiple scanners caused the error, feeding data into the tabulation system at once.

An [article](https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/mystery-missing-votes-deepens-congress-investigates-georgia/x4OTY0ylxfA0Z0Rg6wjkyN/) on irregularities in the 2018 midterms in GA begins

> To find a clue about what might have gone wrong with Georgia’s election last fall, look no further than voting machine No. 3 at the Winterville Train Depot outside Athens.

>On machine No. 3, Republicans won every race. On each of the other six machines in that precinct, Democrats won every race.

**Claim**: A very serious instance of (electronic) vote-flipping has taken place in Antrim County, MI, where 6,000 Trump votes were accidentally flipped to Biden. This has been one of the most widely reported instances recently, usually accompanied by a note that 47 other counties in Michigan used the same faulty software as that responsible for the vote-flipping in Antrim County. 

**Response**: More accurately, the actual votes themselves weren't switched at all here; and for that matter, the error seems to have been more human than electronic. What appears to have happened is that a county clerk hadn't manually updated the software which was responsible for compiling the votes for reporting; and [consequently](https://www.michigan.gov/som/0,4669,7-192-47796-544676--,00.html), ""even though the tabulators counted all the ballots correctly, those accurate results were not combined properly when the clerk reported unofficial results.""

[Edit:] A while after writing this, by chance I came across some more info which either sheds more light on all this, or makes the whole thing a bit more complicated (or both). According to [this AP article](https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-technology-voting-michigan-6beeef230376e75252d6eaa91db3f88f), the President of the company who made the voting software explained that ""a minor correction was made to a ballot that caused additional compounding changes to how the software totals and presented the data""; and an [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/technology/no-software-glitches-are-not-affecting-vote-counts.html) in the NYTimes similarly states that election security experts and state officials concluded ""that an election worker had configured ballot scanners and reporting systems with slightly different versions of the ballot.""

**Claim**: There was suspicious activity around items and containers brought into a Detroit absentee ballot counting center in the early hours of November 4, after the deadline for these to arrive. 

**Response**: This claim — including video footage and pictures — was [shared](https://twitter.com/EricTrump/status/1324146810395463686) by Eric Trump; and in it it's been [intimated](https://texasscorecard.com/federal/video-wagons-suitcases-and-coolers-roll-into-detroit-voting-center-at-4-am/) that these were fraudulent absentee ballots. However, the man in the video footage has been [identified](https://twitter.com/rossjonesWXYZ/status/1324213924250660869) as an employee of Detroit's ABC affiliate WXYZ; and the items in question were his camera equipment.

She guided him toward a towering, overgrown archway that led outside, where the true splendor of Ilthea was just a glimpse. As they stepped through, the air was immediately filled with the scent of early-blooming night-vines, their luminescent petals casting a glow even in the fading daylight. The western, diplomatic district sprawled before them-gleaming spires intertwined with lush, cascading greenery, white walkways suspended between trees, and streams of crystal-clear water winding through the streets.

The planning alone took our entire caste of scholars - no resource was taken without being replenished, but still, nothing was spared."" She hesitated, then added carefully, ""I imagine it must seem... very different from the cities of Earth. From-from what I have seen, in your … records."" What does he think of our lack of walls? Our open markets, our cultural works, that are touted at each corner so proudly? The lack of pollution anywhere? But she held her tongue for now, four ears quietly fluttering, allowing him to absorb the sight of it all before pressing further. His eyes took it in with quiet fascination. This must be the first thing that she found so peculiar about humans… they all seemed so quiet.

""It must have taken decades to complete..."", he commented with an almost inaudible air of wonder, staring up and down at the spiraling structures of the Towers of the First Accord. “I have never seen something quite like this…”

Iz's ears flicked in amusement, a soft, melodic hum escaping her as she followed his gaze upward. ""Decades?"" she echoed, her voice laced with a quiet pride. ""Oh, no-*centuries*. Some of these spires have stood for over a thousand years, maintained and refined with each generation."" 

She gestured toward a particularly grand structure – though that would be hard to pin down in Vaelith - with its surface shimmering an iridescent sheen as if woven from liquid pearl. ""That one next to them-the Luminis Spire-was first erected during the Age of First Bloom. It was designed to catch the light of our twin suns at dawn and dusk, scattering it across the city like a blessing."" Her tail gave a gentle sway as she spoke, ""We do not believe in haste when it comes to creation. Every detail is... considered. Every curve, every material chosen to honor the balance of form and function… speaking of which, there is a garden not far from here. I believe you might like it…"" 

His gaze followed the skyline, eyes barely touching the ground as she adjusted their path. The interior gradually faded, white corridors replaced by an open space rich with the scent of Vaelith, soothing and herbal like the Ilthean south. The garden connected harmoniously, mathematically precise – Iz herself designed a fern here, in a manner that its leaves perfectly approximated Pi’s first 50 digits in what humans called a Fourier Series.  Before she could comment on it however, the human had already conquered the bench, admiring a genetically engineered waste bucket. Iz almost screamed when he bared his teeth, but quickly composed herself, clinging onto the tablet. *It was a yawn, Iz…* 

“Excuse me. It has been quite a journey,” he said, in an apologetic tone. He was tired. She had been drowning him in conversation, and all this time he did not even have the opportunity to sit down – Iz had read thousands of pages of his culture’s work and didn’t once think *he’d need to sit down*.

“I’m sorry, of course, yes... no harm in it, is there?” 

A rhetorical question. Iz learned about those. A question not meant to be answered - the sheer paradox of it captivated Iz’s imagination and pen. Her cohort-mate grew tired of it fairly quickly – *but what did she know?*  

She set the slim device between them and joined him on the cushion. The human’s eyes were still busy with the garden’s scenery.  

""Regarding my question… this garden, or our spires… does such patience exist among humans?"" she asked, her voice carefully neutral. ""Or do your people prefer to build... *swiftly*?"" The question was diplomatic, but beneath it lay a deeper curiosity. The question seemed to pull the human back to the present, his back and strong, decorated fabric straightening once more. 

""Before I answer... what is your natural lifespan?""  He asked, running his paw – no, his… *hand* \- across the surface of the bench. 

Iz's ears stiffened slightly at the question, her tail going still. A flicker of hesitation passed through her before she answered - measured, precise, recalculated to human years in her head. ""The average Ilthean lives between 300 to 350 of your Earth years,"" she said, her voice as steady as possible. ""Though some of our scholars and spiritual leaders have reached around 400 cycles."" 

""And yours?"" she asked softly, though she already knew the answer. The reports had been very clear: humans burned bright and fast. Like *fire*. Like predators on the hunt, who had no time to waste. She watched his fingers trace the outline of the alloy’s frame. The contrast was there - his blunt, grasping digits against the smooth, organic alloy of Ilthean craftsmanship. 

""It is ... different. Our natural lifespan reaches 90 of our years, more for some, but for many... *less*. Life to us must be like a fleeting dream to you..."" he seemed to almost shrink at this fact, gaze cast down over the railing at the edge of the garden overlooking the unhurried streets below. 

Iz's breath caught in her throat, her ears lowering slightly as she absorbed his words. The thought was... unsettling. To live so briefly, to rush through existence like a spark in the dark - how could any species thrive under such pressure? Her four ears tilted forward, betraying her curiosity despite her diplomatic poise.  

She hesitated before speaking, choosing her words with care. ""To us, such brevity is... difficult to comprehend,"" she admitted, her voice low. ""We take centuries to perfect a single art, to nurture a bond, to *understand* one another. But you-"" Her gaze flickered to him, studying the way the twin suns caught in his eyes, metal on his fabric colorful like the garden. ""You must learn, create and *live* in the span of a single Ilthean adolescence. I myself am barely just 85…"" 

A quiet tension coiled in her chest. Was that why humans were so… *hungry*? So relentless? Why they *eat* other beings? Their development had been grand – comparable to Ilthea already, in a dizzyingly short amount of time. Though their history seemed... with many holes and hiccups during that progress. If she had only decades to her life, what would she chase with such fervor? Would it not make sense to take more for herself – *living or not*? 

""...Does it frighten you?"" she asked suddenly, the question slipping out before she could stop it. ""Knowing how much *less* time you have than others?"" She silently chastised herself. This was a diplomatic, cultural exchange, not a *meditation class*.

He pondered the question for a moment. ""It does,"" he said. The soft tinkling of the lichen played on Iz’s ears. Below, the traffic murmured upwards like a gentle gust of wind.  

""But my fear changes nothing."" 

Iz's ears pressed back against her skull, her chest tightening at the raw honesty in his voice. For a moment, she forgot to be diplomatic - forgot to analyze, to assess. Instead, she felt. 

""That is... remarkable,"" she murmured. ""To carry such weight and still move forward."" Her tail curled around her thigh, a nervous tick of hers. ""We Iltheans- we have the luxury of time. We can afford patience, deliberation. But you..."" She trailed off, her blue eyes searching his face. ""You must build, love, strive, *live* \- knowing how swiftly it will all be taken from you."" 

A strange warmth bloomed in her chest - something between admiration and sorrow. She had spent so long fearing what humanity's reckless, downright predatory nature might mean for the galaxy. But now, faced with the quiet courage of this fleeting being, she wondered if she had misunderstood them entirely. Their pale moon, the Blue Mother, peered through the tall clouds above, as another gondola headed to the heavens above, raking upwards on thin wire. Her ears lifted slightly, a tentative softness in her gaze. ""Perhaps... that is why your people reached the stars so quickly. *You had to*."" 

 

“That concerns you, does it not? That we had to *run* before we could *walk*?”  

Those direct words pierced between Iz’s defenses. It took her effort to not tremble at the observant question. Though it went beyond that – she was not concerned, she was *terrified*. They all were. The galactic community, frail as it was, had not seen anything like this. Carnivory. A species, making leap after leap, without slowing down, no, accelerating as they went. That leapt from their moon to their solar system and beyond, before the Ilthean elders decided on their *name*. What drove these beings? 

The concept of such… drive, such inexhaustible fervor, was alien to her in every sense - Ilthean philosophy spoke of cycles, of gradual growth, of the universe's infinite patience. But this? This seemed like *fire*. This was the desperate, clawing thought that time was not a river to wade through, but a wildfire to outrun. Before it choked you, and consumed you alive. *Running before walking*, she repeated in her head. 

 

The Ilthean found herself on her legs, stepping close to the railing without thinking, her voice hushed against the rising air.  

""You are right,” she admitted, “to us… it is... terrifying. To all of us, all members of the First Accord."" Her tail curled tight against her back. ""And yet -"" Her gaze flickered over his face, tracing the lines of his stoic expression. ""I think there is a kind of *beauty* in your struggle, isn't there? To know your limits so intimately, to rage against them even as you test them..."" 

For the first time, she envied humans. Their urgency, their hunger - it was scary, yes, but also *vibrant*. Her gaze was drawn to the main avenue again, where another precession was moving past. Another grand poet was parading his works, evidently inspired by the grand, first-contact ceremony between their two races. It was moving slower than the clouds above, taking its own pace as Ilthean after Ilthean spoke to recite lines from the great work, joining and leaving the spoken word in a grand, alive chorus. If circumstances had been different, if her application as attaché had been rejected, she would have gladly been part of that beautiful thing. But… now it seemed almost trivial to her. She wondered how he viewed it. Would he even understand? A treacherous thought burned in her head. *Perhaps he was right not to.* Perhaps humanity was alive in a way her people had forgotten long ago. 

""Tell me… your history… why…” The request was impulsive, undiplomatic - but she no longer cared. She needed to understand, “… why this *urgency*? That… burns, even against one another? Against *your own kin*? Did it have to be this way? On Ilthea, we have solved every problem, every disagreement, with *dialogue*, *thought* and *time* –“  

She cut herself off, realizing her sheer naivete. Iz knew this species did not have this luxury. Had not the *lush opulence* provided by good Ilthea. Did not have the calm ecological niches for them to rise with gradually, organically, in a warding harmony. Never could afford to trade *good enough* for *perfect*. Iz cursed herself silently, four ears fluttering in embarrassment. Though the human did not laugh at her – something she learned humans often subjected another to.  

""I suppose that… ambition was ingrained into us, from our early years. *Lowly mammals*, scrapping to survive. We took grand steps... some forwards, many backwards..."" he joined her on the railing. 

Iz's claws flexed against the alloy as she absorbed his words. ""*Ambition*,"" she repeated softly. ""We have no true equivalent in our language. The closest term translates to... '*the reaching of roots toward water*.'"" Her ears flicked downward, a shadow passing over her expression. ""But yours is not so patient, is it? Yours would be a *clawing*.” The term sat heavy in her mind, so human in its implications - a species that clawed its way up from nothing, that refused to accept its place in the natural order. Iltheans were practically groomed to be their planet’s rulers. *Not so with humanity*, or so the Xenohistorians surmised: humanity’s rise from cradle to the stars was a painful affair. Some even referred to it as a *conquest*, though Iz revolted at the term.   

She exhaled slowly, ""You spoke of it all so... *casually*,"" she murmured. ""What you did, to… just survive.... for us, such thinking is - "" She hesitated, searching for the right word. ""*Unthinkable*. We evolved in abundance, in harmony."" A strange tension coiled in her chest.  

""We did not,"" he commented neutrally, the way only a human could have. ""Mother Earth was not all kind to us. And for many of our ancestors, that… old night was cold and dark."" 

*Cold and dark*. The words seemed in Iz’s chest like a weight. She had read the reports, of course - the reconstructions of Earth’s brutal ecosystems, the simulations of early human survival. But hearing it from him, so starkly, so *matter-of-factly* \- it made something in her gut twist. She could not bear that thought, to see your own fellow being … cease to be, randomly, but with terrifying certainty. From the uncaring cold, or worse, from another Ilthean.  

""We knew your world was... *harsher* than ours,"" she admitted, her voice a whisper. ""But to hear you speak of it -"" She cut herself off. How could she even articulate the horror? The *wrongness* of it? Ilthea had never known true scarcity, true *predation*. She dropped the thought, but the human continued it. 

""Our ancestors were wise, however. They saw the dark, and created *fire*,"" said the human, ""... they had to make fire - had to learn to *run*, first.” 

Her tail was restless. She had seen the reconstructed records of human history, the way their civilizations flickered and flared, some burning out too soon, others spreading like wildfire. It was nothing like the slow, steady glow of Ilthean progress. 

Her ears trembled nervously, as she struggled to reconcile this philosophy with everything she knew. ""So… you *ran*,"" she echoed, her voice hollow. ""While we... *walked*."" The realization set in. All this time, her people had assumed humanity's rapid advancement was a sign of recklessness, of danger. Another attribute of a carnivorous species. But what if it was simply necessity? What if they had no other choice? 

She eyed the Luminis Spire, that stood for a thousand years, having been perfected by each generation. And then she thought of human cities - built in decades, rebuilt in years, reinvented between Ilthean breaths. 

 ""...We had never needed that … *fire* the way you did,"" she admitted softly. ""Perhaps, if things had been as hard for our ancestors, we would have been far across the universe by now…"" The words tasted bitter, heretical. To imply that Ilthean peace was anything less than *perfection* was unthinkable - and yet, here she was, thinking it. 

“But we are both here… with or without it…” he said, features settling in what Iz knew to be a relaxed expression.  She exhaled softly.

""Yes,"" she murmured, quieter now, less guarded. ""We are."" 

For a moment, she allowed herself to simply look at him - not as a predator, not as a potential threat, but as... a *person*. A being who had fought a different kind of battle than her people ever had. Body shaped for labor, for running in the most literal sense. For struggle and strife. For tracking and hunting in the heat of savannah or the biting frost. And yet, here they both stood, from worlds lightyears apart, beneath the same blue sky. 

She tried to measure her tone. ""Did you believe our records? The pictures of Ilthea? Our history? Or did they seem… too good to be true to you?” 

“We did believe you, but me, personally? I still wanted to set foot on another planet, and see it with my own eyes. To do what my ancestors could only dream of. Grasp the stars…” he said, appendage tentatively raised to the gently blinking twin suns above, tiny shadows dancing on his face. 

Her chest tightened. She had never *yearned* for them the way he described. To them, the stars were simply... there. A part of Ilthea's harmony, not a challenge to be met. But the way he spoke - with such quiet reverence, such *awe* \- it made something in her stir. A feeling she couldn't name. 

*Was he not angry?* The thoughts swirled in her head. To see what they had built without ever needing to *take* it? Grasping for the lights above with stubby digits, reaching it through struggle – then meeting those who never *reached*, who never *struggled*. But now, seeing themselves here on this other world, had they not achieved enough? A part of her wanted to tell him, directly. That they did not have to *run* anymore. But another part of her knew that he would not understand. And that must have been at the center of Iz’s fear.  

Part of her recoiled at the idea - such waste, such chaos. But another part, small and traitorous, again thrilled at it. To be cold and hungry, having nothing… but wanting everything? The sheer audacity of a species that looked at the stars, reached out their hand and said: *‘Mine’*. 

""We have records - ancient poems, carvings - of when we first reached the stars,"" she said softly. ""But for us, it was... inevitable. A natural progression."" She hesitated, ""...but I see now that… for you, it was a *victory*."" The word felt heavy, significant. ""Wasn't it?"" 

He nodded, seemingly comforted at her words. ""It was a hard-fought victory. Against nature... against ourselves. It did not come easy to us.""  

The implication hung in the air. For *you*, it was *easy*. For us, it was conquest. It was *war* \- that peculiar term that terrified Iz. Her ears flattened, her tail curling tight against her back as if to shield herself from the very concept. She had studied it, of course - the reports, the simulations, the endless debates among Ilthean scholars about how a species could turn on itself with such violence, on such a scale, over and over again - If it even was possible. Doubts that were quickly washed away once first contact was established, and the humans sent all their records willingly. As if that had not been the most *profane* document Iz had ever seen with her long, blue eyes.  

""That fact…,"" she quivered, ""...the idea that your people could - that you did - "" She cut herself off, tail flexing against the railing. ""We have no equivalent. No framework to even understand it. And yet... you can speak of it as if it were just another step. Another tool. As if war was your nature…"" 

His gravely voice was an odd tone now, almost… remorseful. 

""It is, in a way. We were born in *war*. *Peace* was something we had to learn..."" 

Iz went rigid, her fur bristling along her spine. *Born in war*. The phrase echoed in her skull, dark and primal. Her ears flattened against her skull. ""You... *invented* peace?"" The words tasted strange on her tongue. To her, peace was like air - ever-present, unquestioned. The thought of it being a *construct*, something fragile and hard-won... 

""...We invited you here,"" she said slowly, ""because we feared what you might do if left unchecked."" Her blue eyes locked onto his, and his were as a still sea, every word silently sinking beneath. ""But now I wonder if we should have feared what you might teach us instead."" 

The admission hung between them, charged. For the first time since his arrival, Iz was aware of the chasm between their cultures. The utter incomprehensibility of one side to the other. How not just their world, but her way of living was at risk. What if those ideas spread here too, just like on his Earth? Would it not burn Ilthean culture to ash?

""We figured as much, which is why we waited for you to invite us, rather than the other way around…” he said, his tone carefully measured. *He did not want to judge … but he was tense*, she thought.

“Tell me, Iz… when your people saw into the dark, what did you think you would find? What was it you see?”

She followed his gaze upwards to the stars, her lower ears twitching as she considered the question. What were the stars? A constant, gentle presence. The backdrop of a beautiful, weaving still-life that included Ilthea.  

""When we look,"" she began softly, ""we see harmony. Patterns. The same cycles that govern our world, reflected in the heavens."" she relaxed at the thought, ""Color, and vibrancy, life... and with each member of the First Accord that feeling only intensified… forgive me, but… silent? I do not understand.” 

 

The human stiffened, almost painfully. 

“When we peeled our eyes skywards, it did not look this way to us...”

Iz could not stop herself.

“You… feared it, didn’t you?” 

“I want to say that we respected it, but… you are probably right.”  

A pause. Then, quieter, she complemented his thought. 

""You saw them cold and dark... just like your home. Is that why you build your… *war-ships*?” she carefully asked. Iz realized that this was veering dangerously into topics the human might object to talk about, but something made her ask it anyway. It was a concept, so disturbing – so *paradoxical* to her. It was an oxymoron – two opposites, combined: spaceflight and progress together with barbarity and predation – the epitome of both peace, and *war*.  

""You embraced us, welcomed us, and you accepted us, and for that humanity is forever grateful,” his words become one with the murmur of Vaelith, the gentle swaying of the golden lichen, ""but...before first contact… it was for us as it was for our ancestors. We were alone, and the stars were cold and silent. Have you ever considered… *why*?”  

Her claws flexed and she whispered ""But… to build those… *things*…” 

 

“How can I explain? There is an old saying…” the human seemed amused, a seemingly old memory flooding to him. “Speak softly… but carry a big stick.” 

Her ears shot upright, her tail puffing out in alarm before she could stop it. *A big stick*. The euphemism was almost playful, but the meaning beneath it was anything but. She had seen the reports and images - humanity's warships – blocky, stretched steel, rife with implements their scholars were still trying to identify. Rather… undignified compared to the carefully preened Ilthean vessels, but hard, enduring, and *teeming*. Their expansion had already surpassed the limits of the First Accord's charts, and still they ventured on without pause, like stones sinking into deep, black waters.

Their automated deterrence strategies. Machined intelligence – utterly taboo on Ilthea – whose purpose was only to preserve the human defensive lines in cold, unfeeling calculus. To her people, such things were monstrous. Unthinkable. 

Then, all at once, it clicked. Humanity hadn't reached the stars - they had conquered them, just as their world. From their caves, to continents, to the cosmos. They never stopped. Not just out of curiosity, but defiance, to keep that fire burning. The thought was equal parts awe-inspiring and terrifying. 

""...Did your people ever... plan for us?"" The question was rife with danger, Iz knew as much, but she was more scared of the answer. ""Before first contact. Before all ceremonies, before all … this. Did you prepare for the possibility that we might be... a *threat*?""  

He pressed his lips together, in thought for a moment.

“…but you were kind to us,” the human said simply.   

Iz's breath caught in her throat as his words dug their way in, and the human beside her suddenly did not seem small at all. The implication was clear - humanity's grace was not inherent, but *chosen*. A deliberate restraint that could be *withdrawn*. The human was not a predator, but a *soldier*. A soldier in a war that had lasted millennia before her ancestors even dreamed of tools. A soldier that had *chosen* peace. Not because he couldn't do otherwise, but because he *hadn't needed to*. 

A terrible understanding dawned in her. Of course they had built their warships, their orbital platforms. They hadn't known the galaxy was filled with *herbivores*, with *pacifists*. Her breath came shallow now, her pulse racing. ""You did *war-game* us,"" she breathed, horrified. War-game. Another terrible, human oxymoron. ""You were running war games …before you even knew what we were. You had strategies. *Contingencies*."" The thought was sickening. The stars above seemed suddenly colder, sharper - no longer just points of light, but targets. How many of them had humans already reached? *How many more would they claim?* 

She swallowed hard. ""You are saying... your kindness now, your peace… is a *gift*. Not a nature. That your people could have come to us with fire and teeth, but instead... you came with open hands."" 

The realization was at once humbling and horrifying. All this time, the Iltheans had assumed their peaceful ways made them superior. But now? Now she wondered if they were simply *lucky* that humanity had decided to play by rules older than their civilization.  

The human did not say anything, still deliberating. The golden lichen softly chimed, and when it paused, Iz could only watch as the human slowly picked up her tablet, and expertly navigated her device with stubby digits. He paused the tablet’s recording with a swipe of his fingers. 

“You… you can read Ilthean?”  

""I had plenty of time to learn during my journey… but please, listen carefully. You should know that it goes deeper.” he again kept his voice steady, diplomatic, but a turbulent undercurrent remained.  

Iz listened with bated breath. 

""After unification day, our scientists and weapon engineers never stopped working. There is an installation, within our inner asteroid belt. It is a weapon; the greatest humanity has ever built. Virtually undetectable, it harvests asteroids and refines them into ultra-dense munitions. It can launch them, at a considerable fraction of the speed of light. A kinetic artillery that can reach anywhere.”  

Iz's entire body went deathly still. Her ears pinned back so sharply it hurt, her fur standing on end as if charged with static. The glittering of the lichen seemed obscene in the silence. 

Though physics was not her strong suit, the calculations unfolded in her Ilthean mind with horrifying ease and clarity. Kinetic impulse of that relativistic scale could reduce cities to craters in the blink of an eye. Render entire biospheres uninhabitable – no, crack entire worlds in two. Ilthea had no defenses. Not even a plan. 

 

When she finally spoke, her voice didn't sound like her own - it was too raw, too small. ""You... you built a doomsday device while *pretending* at diplomacy?"" Her breath came in shallow gasps. ""Was this always your plan? To study us, learn our weaknesses, and then- "" 

She cut herself off, trembling. The beautiful spires around them suddenly felt like targets. The open streets, like kill zones. Every Ilthean going about their day in blissful ignorance - playing music in the gardens, debating philosophy in the shade of thousand-year-old towers. Never suspecting that their new 'allies' had already aimed at them from the start. 

""Why tell me this?"" she demanded, voice cracking. ""Is this a threat? A warning?"" The words tasted like bile. All her careful diplomacy, her attempts at understanding - had they ever mattered at all? 

""No, Iz, you misunderstand. We did not build this weapon with **you** in mind."" he said, words heavy, dragged out.  

*Not for us.* 

The human retrieved his own device, akin to her tablet, but bulkier and in black – an Ilthean would have refused to even gaze their eyes upon such a thing – but Iz was stunned and drank it in. 

“Watch.” 

The black material came to life with a seemingly ancient recording. Humans were out and about, and their singular sun shone above white sand, not unlike the sands Iz remembered from their southern coast. The recording panned up, and revealed their large, cratered moon, which Iz had grown fond of from humanity’s depictions. All greater was her horror then, when a dash of white light struck its side, pieces visible in the blue sky for just a blink, and the feed cut to black. Iz stared at her own reflection in stunned silence. The screen turned on again, showing their blue marble, a dash of *red* – like a gaping wound - cut across its surface. Horrible pictures kept flooding the space, cities and bodies consumed by flame, and Iz had to look away to not throw up. 

“Our moon saved us that day,” he said, scratching his face-fur, “Their timing was off, by a few short *hours*. Mere Femtoradians with a cosmic scope, I’d imagine. Yet, *tens of millions* died, many more when the fragments rained down.”  

“Wha-what was it? An-an asteroid, or?”  

“A *missile*.” 

“Are you sure? Not… a wayward comet, or…?” 

The question died halfway out of her mouth. Iz was unable to explain away what she saw. It had been so fast, she could count each frame in her head before the light sprang from moon to their planet. A mere second, if at all.

“Too many heavy elements. Definitely artificial. Launched with *purpose*. It was what we would call a *kill-missile*.” 

“But… who, what kind of *monstrous*… mind would use this weaponry? Without reason – without even reaching out to…”  

Iz shuddered, struggling to grasp it all. The human spoke again. 

“So… yes, to us the stars were not something that seemed welcoming. The night was dark…”  

Iz could see it now, Ilthea in flames. Light from the heavens, burning bright for an instance, then forever extinguished, swallowed by the stars. The human’s voice kept her anchored. 

“…but, from our ancestors, we had *learned*… we knew what to do.” 

""And you made your *fire*…” Iz completed his thought. “You... you think they will come back. *Finish the job*.” she whispered. ""Some… merciless *genocider*, amongst the dark? That erased world after world, keeping the universe silent?"" Her tail coiled tight around her leg, her entire body trembling. ""And, after realizing this, instead of hiding or praying… *your first instinct was to build a gun pointed at the dark*!?"" 

The human nodded. 

A hysterical laugh bubbled up in her throat. All this time, the Iltheans had pitied humans for their short, violent lives. She shuddered. *What if they did come back?!* The galaxy suddenly felt vast and *hungry* in ways her civilization had never dared imagine. And this brief, brutal creature beside her? Had it deciphered the universe all along? Iz felt sick, and held onto the railing for dear life. *For humanity, it had never been about the Iltheans at all.* 

Her heart stopped as another terrible thought struck her. ""That weapon you built,"" she whispered. ""… it was… it *is* for *everyone* that would threaten you. Like your ships… your … machines. And… had we,” she bit her blue tongue, “… *been hostile* …that would have included *us*.""  

It hung between them, unspoken. Iz finally understood the human saying. *Speak softly, but carry a big stick*… all their diplomacy, their cultural exchange - it was just the *preferred* option. Not the only one. Never the only one. All this time, her people had feared what humanity *was* \- but they had never stopped to consider what it was that humanity *feared*. 

""We're children,"" she breathed, staring at her shaking paws. ""Playing in a garden we never fathomed might be surrounded by… *bones*."" The admission tasted like ash. All their art, their philosophy, their peace - how much of it was just luck? That some great evil had its back turned on them, for *a* *cosmic minute*? 

""… you had it all planned, hadn’t you? How to erase our population centers. How to decipher our communications, how to coordinate… *interstellar war* beyond what we could comprehend. Against all members of the First Accord... you thought… *we* were that threat at first, didn’t you?” 

His gaze was tired, and his voice was with a tone that Iz thought resembled ... remorse. ""Iz… by now, you know the answer, don’t you? We had been drilling endlessly for such an event. Not just a rod in the dark. A *true* first contact. Bunkers, evacuation plans, early warning satellites, scattered throughout systems, all were at the ready. The *rods* were in their silos. We always expected to be struck first... so we waited for your move. And waited, until you contacted us in our own language. And… you had made... **songs** for us. We had not expected this. We hadn't even planned for it... frankly, we did not know what to do."" 

Her people had spent centuries observing Earth, debating the ethics of contact, carefully crafting their approach over decades. All that time, humanity had been *hunkered down*, fingers on triggers, staring at the stars like sentries waiting for an ambush. While her people had spent millennia composing symphonies to the dark above, they had been preparing to *fight* it. Or, at least, *take it down with them*. 

""You... you thought first contact would be *gunfire*,"" she choked out, nodding, her ears trembling. ""Of course… since you think the natural state of the universe is *war*."" Her claws scraped, leaving faint marks against the alloy.  

“It sure seems that way to us.” 

Iz knew not what to answer. 

""And when we came speaking of peace, you must have thought it was a *trick.* A trick of those who had hurt you..."" 

She looked up at the human, who was scanning the procession down below with curious eyes. ""We thought we were civilizing you,"" she admitted. He met her gaze, sympathetic.

“Sorry to say… but, we could tell…” a chuckle rang from this throat. How could he still be so calm? Her doubts were so clear now. Their peaceful utopia – had it really been a *fluke*? A temporary bubble in a cosmos that rewarded that exact, human blend of paranoid, pragmatic violence and intellect? 

""You... you lived like that? Waiting to be struck, again? Preparing to *burn the sky* in response?"" The concept was unthinkable. No Ilthean could function under such existential dread - they'd wither from the stress alone. Yet here the human stood. Not just functioning, but *thriving*. Building. Exploring. Even now, this one spoke with grim clarity rather than madness. 

The calculations raced in Iz’s mind, and the severity of it all took hold: The wider galaxy *was* silent. Suspiciously so. The thought was revolting, but… what if someone really was *perpetuating* that silence, with those unthinkable terror-weapons? Her people and the First Accord had called the silence of the cosmos serenity. Humans saw the same and called it a *warning*, then a *danger*. And yet, even with tireless searching, there could always be a world left unturned, harboring what nightmares dwell in human minds. Iz understood then. For their own survival, humanity couldn’t stop *burning*. The twin suns cast her two shadows long and trembling across the ground. 

""Do you understand what you're telling me?"" she whispered. ""That your entire species has been holding its breath, waiting for the galaxy to show its teeth once more?"" Her tail lashed violently. ""And instead of that... you got *us*."" 

""It is funny how the universe works sometimes, isn't it?"" the human gave, smiling wearily, ""But we are relieved that we discovered you, instead of the others..."" 

The casual way he acknowledged *that what dared called itself an intelligence* made her stomachs churn. The greatest horror the Ilthean mind could conceive had been a *slightly aggressive trade negotiation* up until an hour or so. 

She rose slowly on unsteady legs, her fur still partially bristled. ""You are relieved,"" she repeated.

“I am. We *all* were.” 

The garden was quiet for a moment. 

""We have no defenses,"" she admitted. ""No plans. No contingencies. If the galaxy is as dangerous as you fear... if it came for us… we would not survive."" The admission tasted bitter.  

""But you would. Your ... '*big stick'* would save you.""

""Humanity's history taught us the fine difference between peaceful and harmless…” the human worded carefully, measured, to not cause much offense in Iz, at least that was how it seemed to her. It stung anyway.

""You're saying...that my people are the latter."" The realization felt like frost. ""That we built this … harmless paradise because we never had to *fight* for it. Because nothing tried to *take it from us*…"" Iz's ears drooped. *Peaceful, not harmless*. The distinction cut deeper than any claw could. 

“Your people never needed to learn,” he tried to put her at ease.  

*And perhaps that has doomed us*, Iz mused.  

She simply stared at Vaelith's shimmering spires - so pristine, so *fragile*. They lasted a thousand years because no one had ever *tested* them. No predators in the dark night. No rods from gods. Just... peace. *Taken for granted*. 

A humorless laugh escaped her. ""And now here you are,"" she murmured, ""holding our innocence at gunpoint just by *existing*. You don't even have to *do* anything. The moment I grasped what you were, saw what you showed me… it seemed like the galaxy stopped being the one I knew..."" 

""...We need to talk to your leaders,"" she said abruptly, straightening her posture with visible effort. ""*Properly*. No more diplomatic dances. Because if the universe is as dark as you believe... we need this... *fire* of yours, more than ever…“ 

For the first time since his arrival, Iz didn't look nervous around the human. She looked afraid of everything else. The human straightened his back, and the metal on his chest reflected golden in the suns. 

“I agree. Together, our chances are greater – we would be honored to teach you."" 

Iz's tail uncoiled from around her leg as she studied the human's face for any hint of deception. Finding none, she felt a tinge of warmth.

""*...Honored*?"" she repeated softly, her voice trembling with cautious wonder. ""After everything you've just told me, after knowing what we are - *soft, slow, unprepared -* you would still call it an honor? Not a *drag*?"" 

A strange emotion flickered in her. Not fear, not awe - something closer to hope. Humanity had clawed its way to the stars with bloodied hands, yes... but they were offering to extend those same hands to lift her people up, not strike them down. She reached out hesitantly, her clawed paws against the railing near his hand - not touching, but close enough to feel the warmth radiating from his skin. ""Then teach us,"" she whispered. ""... how to face this ... dark."" 

“We will,” the human agreed with no second-guessing, “and Iz… once our people are ready…”  

The human’s face now was steeled with a steadfastness that Iz would have shuddered at before, but made her chest tighten with resolve now.

“…we will find whoever cast that rod. If it takes *centuries*. If it takes *millennia*. But we will find them. And perhaps then, both of us can teach them the distinction between *peaceful* and *harmless*.”  

Iz found herself gripped by the image and clutched that comfort as her gaze drifted to the stars - no longer just beautiful, but watchful. Cold and dark. In truth, she was terrified at their newly made meaning. But beside her, the human stood, unmoved by all this, surely and steadily planning in his mind.

2021-04-29 20:27:42,"The Emperor, in his infinite wisdom, has tasked each primarch with making a sword. The Lion: 

Growing up feral in a hell forest has given the lion a soft spot for hunting. As far as he's concerned, a good sword needs to be able to slay any beast. As a result, the sword is as long as him, with a chopping blade so wide it could be a paddle.

[REDACTED]: 

Even ****** was surprised at the *****. ****** seems unnecessary but ***** ****** ****** malleable ******.

Fulgrim: 

Misunderstands the task but makes a really nice hammer for his bro Ferrus. Surprisingly practical for the phoenician, a beautiful example of friendship between two besties.

Perturabo: 

Makes 10 swords, each sword is relatively unimaginative but all are a superb quality. When finished, he swings each sword into his biggest anvil. The expert craftsmenship makes the swords incredibly resilient but eventually most bend or shatter. Standing in a pile of broken and shattered metal Perturabo only has 1 sword left, the strongest one.

The Great Khan: 

A fast man needs a fast sword. A rapier is the obvious choice. Long, sharp, and light, the Khan can stab 2 flys at opposite ends of a room before the first has hit the ground.

Leman Russ: 

This sword is a strange one, it has an incredibly long handle and an axe shaped blade. Malcador informs the Wolf King that he's just made an axe, Leman says he's a fool as it's clearly a wolf sword. Regardless, it splits xenos and logs with ease.

Rogal Dorn: 

Dorn desperately wants to make a hefty sheild that could stand up to even Perturabo's blade. He can't do this though because the task was to make a sword, so to make anything else would be foolish. In the end the sword looks plain, but it's remarkably strong and practical. The parallels between Dorn and Perturabo's swords are uncanny.

Curze: 

While not particularly long or heavy, Konrad's sword is razor sharp and absolutely covered in spikes. The sword couldn't stand up to those made by the other Primarchs but that's not the goal, it will turn any human into a meat salad with a single swing. Oddly humain in a morally grey way, sheer vicious damage done to the 1st man causes the others to surrender.

Sanguinius: 

An absolutely beautiful sword, gold decoration from pummel to tip. It would look more at home on Fulgrims wall than in a battle but don't let that fool you. A longsword based design with razer sharp edges and near indestructible blade. The sword would be perfect if not for a thin line of rust going through the middle of the blade. Impossible to see but one day the sword will fail because of its' rotting core.

Ferrus Manus: 

Sword making is usually just another day for the Gorgon but this one is special because he knows his best bud Fulgrim is making something special for him. To honour his brother he makes a beautiful saber that glows with scorching heat. Along with the blade, an even stronger bond is forged between two brothers.

[REDACTED]: 

The ******** Primarch needs the ******** sword. A blade made of pure ****** and a hilt that *******. If the swords were made to ****** this would be a clear ******.

Angron: 

Angron has a unique problem in that his unrestrained rage will snap most swords at the hilt when used. In remembrance of his childhood he makes a gladiatorial shortsword. The small size is unusual but intentional. The blade is thick and the shortness gives less leverage to stop it from snapping. While the least impressive at a glance, it's likely the only blade the very, very angry primach could rely on.

Roboute Guilliman: 

The millisecond the request was given he started planning. His first plan was to plan how to format his overall sword construction plan. Once a reasonable system was developed he conducted research on blade shapes, materials, purposes, contexts, and more. He then hones a variety of crafting and construction skills by making tools specifically for making his sword. 

Having become a scholar of forging and fabricating he eventually creates a bland looking blade that will on average be the most practical sword in existence.

Mortarion: 

While he's more comfortable using a scythe, Mortarion was going to build a sword fit for royalty. He searched for the toughest material possible, and worked tirelessly to beat the stubborn metal into shape. Despite breaking multiple anvils and hammers the eventual blade is a practical but elegant sword. 

He then subjects the blade to a series of brutal tests because he believes an unreliable blade is worthless. At the end of the trials the sword is still as strong as before, but there are chips missing that can never be completely smoothed out, a surface corrosion that will always return, and chemical burn marks that will never allow a recreation of the original finish.

Magnus the Red: 

Always the free thinker, Magnus created a unique sword that's a pleasure to look at. The handle is as long as the blade to allow for accuracy and variety, the blade is curved in the style of ancient Egyptian swords. The sword is a warm bronze colour and polished to reflection. The blade meets the polearm handle at a guard shaped like the wings of an eagle, and the feathers look almost too real. It's an objectively brilliant weapon, but to hold it feels strange and unfamiliar.

Horus: 

He designed a blade that's utterly unique, shaped in a way that could counter nearly any other type of sword, providing the user had enough skill. Horus then gathered a team of the best swordmakers he could find and provided the resources they needed to bring his plan to life.

Lorgar: 

Lorgar once read that katanas were the best type of sword, refusing to think for himself, he made a katana. Being a Primarch, of the sword is of course leagues above anything made by a mortal weaponsmith, but it doesn't match the quality of swords made by his brothers. 

Where Lorgar excels is the presentation, the sword comes in a beautiful box, covered in decorations and patterns that would be at home in any gallery. Along with the box is a book about the sword that's so well written a mortal might start worshipping the sword after reading it.

Vulkan: 

Excited to show off one of his favourite skills, he starts forging immediately and follows his intuition. He eventually has a shape for a collosal, cleaver like sword. A lot of care is put into refining the shape to have perfect weight and proportions. 

When finished, the blade was so large that a custodian would find it unwieldy, but in the hands of Vulkan it could cut down a tree in a single swing. Unsatisfied, Vulkan added one last modification that allowed the blade to spew flames, igniting whatever the sword was cutting.

Corvus Corax: 

Not much is known about the construction of this sword, Corvus disappeared shortly after the instructions were given, some time later he reappeared with an incredible weapon. We know the sword is strong, very sharp, and quick to use based on the wounds it leaves, but no one can actually say what it looks like. 

When looking in its direction you're aware there's a sword there somewhere, making your eyes pull it into focus however, seems impossible. It's like it barely exists, the results show it does, but to judge the blade type and movements might be impossible for all but a Primarch.

Alpharius: 

At opposite ends of the galaxy, 2 sets of schematics are found at forges owned by master fabricators that both operate in secret, as their work is made heretical by xenos influence. Each fabricator follows their set of schematics as they're inspired by the wonderful design. They finish constructing the sword at roughly the same time and they're both certain that their sword is the best the planet has ever seen.

One night, a hive-gang breaks in and kills one of the craftsmen in his sleep, taking the sword along with other valuables. Not being aware of the other fabricator, the surviving fabricator meets a very similar fate within a few Terran hours. 

Both gangs each sell everything they stole apart from the swords that they recognise are invaluable. The first gang make the sword a sign of leadership, and over the next week, all butcher each other as they try to take the sword for themselves. When the gruesome scene is discovered by arbites, one of them takes the sword for themselves. 

The 2nd gang was more stable, and the sword was locked away with the other last resort weapons. Within hours they were raided by a much larger, stronger group of hive bandits. The original gang was slaughtered and the weapons storage was raided, the leader of the bandits took the blade for herself.

At the other end of civilisation the 1st blade had been confiscated up the chain of command, within days each person's superior would take it for themselves until eventually the planetary governor was the owner. The governor organised the assassination of everyone that had seen the sword, as well as turning the assassins on themselves until the last people that knew of the weapon were him and the assassin he was using the sword to kill.

The bandit leader that owned the 2nd sword enjoyed it for a few days, before finding herself on the wrong end of a Custodians' guardian spear. The custodian executed every bandit for suspected chaotic corruption but somehow justified keeping such an excellent sword. The Custodian continued on their quest, a task requested by the Emperor himself. Once completed, the Custodian returns to Terra with the sword. The only trace is the thousands of hidden bodies, bodies of those that would try to threaten the Emperor.

The planetary governer countless stars away hides the 1st blade in a gift, and hides the gift in a larger gift, and hides that in a shipment of valuables, that's hidden within a bulk export of weapons. He finalises plans and orders to send the shipment to Terra. Once the shipment is in orbit, the governer returns to his tower, and whispers ""I am Alpharius"" before leaping through the window to his death.

The Custodian relinquishes ownership of the sword once home, feeling it would be improper to have a potentially tainted blade so close to the Emperor. He destroys the blade, reducing the masterful weapon to dust, except the destroyed sword was a double, replacing the original weapon. The replacement being a close enough copy to fool even a Custodian, but lacking the strength and quality inside. 

After years and 8 separate owners, the 1st blade makes it back to Terra on a supply ship, where it also goes missing. 

Alpharius presents his pair of swords sooner than any other Primarch, which would only be possible if he planned this years in advance.

2020-11-02 21:15:39,"Last Week's Annotation Some notes about Jasnah

Hey, all!  As I was working on the annotation for last week’s
chapter, I realized it was touching on something I wanted to talk
about in a more substantive way.  So I decided to put that annotation
off and make a separate, longer and more in-depth, post about it.
This WILL have some small spoilers for the book, specifically some
things to do with Jasnah and her sexual identity.  If you’d rather
just read it as it comes up in the story, then I’d suggest you head
away now--and you can come back to this in a month or two after you’ve
read Rhythm of War.

However, good communication with fans--particularly when it comes
to expectations--is something I consider a foundational principle of
my career.  During the beta read, I had the chance to get a glimpse of
how readers might respond to some aspects of Jasnah, and at that time
I determined I’d do a post like this before the book came out.

So, here’s the problem: through the course of the series, people
have been asking me about Jasnah’s sexuality.  Gay, Bi, Straight,
other?  I usually answer with some variation of the following: “Jasnah
would prefer you focus on other aspects of her identity, rather than
her sexuality.”

I said this for various reasons.  First, I felt it is in line
with the character, and what she would want.  Second, I’ve avoided
talking too much about Jasnah as a general rule, since I plan her to
be a major (perhaps the major) character of the back five books, and
so it’s best to keep focus off her for now.  There will be plenty of
time for discussions about her later.  Third, I generally don’t force
relationships upon my characters as I write.  It depends on the
character, of course.  (Navani/Dalinar, for example, had a romance
planned as a main part of their storyline.)  But for many characters,
I give myself wiggle room to see what I feel works best as the story
develops.

The end result of me being vague on this, however, was that I
seem to have led a lot of people to think I was playing the Brandon
game of: “If he won’t say anything about a topic, it must be
mysterious, and therefore something we should theorize on a ton!”
This is, obviously, my own fault.

I’ve heard a lot of different things via email and in person from
people that have made me realize that a lot of people are wanting some
mutually exclusive things from the character in this regard.  As I
started work on this novel, I decided I should say something in the
book in order to pull back the shroud on the mystery a little, as I
never intended it to get as big as it did.

I tried a few different things to see what worked and was most
genuine for the character.  In the end, I settled on what I felt was
best and most in-line with how I view Jasnah.  For those who want to
know, and I’ll put this next part behind extra spoilers.  >!Jasnah is
asexual, and currently heteroromantic.  Her feelings on physical
intimacy are very neutral, not something she's interested in for its
own sake, but also not something she's opposed to doing for someone
she cares about. I tried several different things with the character,
and this is what really clicked with me--after getting some advice,
suggestions, and help from some asexual readers.!<

One of the reasons I wanted to make this post is because I
wanted to address some of the people who are going to be disappointed
as I worry that I (by making her a blank slate in this regard) accidentally led a lot of people to theorize and attach ideas they wanted to her--and so I’ll inevitably disappoint these people.  (Though,
hopefully, others will find the depiction I ended up with in line with
the characterization and with Jasnah’s overall character mode.)

For the main body of the annotation, I wanted to talk about how
Jasnah came about, and my inspirations.  So if you’ll forgive me for a
moment, I want to walk you down that path--and I think it might
explain some of why I ended up making the decision that I did.

When I was first working on the Stormlight Archive back in 2002,
I decided early on that I wanted a character like Jasnah in the
books, as I was dealing with some gender politics and social
structures.  (I actually pitched Jasnah to myself as “The woman Serene
thinks she is.”  No offense to Serene, she’s just young--and I wanted
to take a stab at a true scholar and master of politics.)

This decision made, I dove into reading a lot of work from
feminist authors--and made certain to talk to some of my feminist
friends in depth about how to accomplish an accurate depiction.  A lot
of times, when I’m developing a character, one or two things will leap
out at me from readings, and I’ll start to use that to make up the
core of the personality.  (Much like the idea of Kaladin came from the
idea of a surgeon, trained to save people, being sent to war and being
trained to kill.)

Jasnah’s atheism was one of these things--specifically I wanted a
rationalist humanist character as a counterpoint to the very
mythological setting I was developing with the Heralds.  I was
extremely excited by the opportunity to have a character who could
offer the in-world scientific reasons why the things that are
happening are happening.

At the same time, one key takeaway I got from these studies was this: several authors and friends be frustrated with the idea that
often in media and discussion, people pretended that a feminist
couldn’t also be feminine.   As it was explained to me, “Saying you
shouldn’t have to play into society’s rules for women shouldn’t also
mean no women should ever decide to play into some of society’s rules
for women.”  It was about choice, and letting women decide--rather
than letting society pressure them. This was central to my creation of
Jasnah.

And so, fundamental to my view of the character is the need for
me to not force her down any path, no matter how much some fans may
want that path to be the right one.  Jasnah being as I’ve written her
was just RIGHT.  I’ve always viewed her as sharing some aspects with
myself, and one of those is the clinical way I approach some things
that others approach emotionally.  While I wouldn’t say I identify in
the same way as her, this part of me is part of a seed for who she is
and how she acts.  And with help from betas, I think I found her true
voice.

All of that said, the people I’m most sad to disappoint here are
those who I know were hoping for Jasnah to be gay.  Out of respect for
these readers, and to be certain, I did try writing the character that
way in this book--and I felt it didn’t quite fit.   Obviously, this is
a character, and not an actual person--and so it’s all a fabrication
anyway.  I could absolutely write Jasnah as gay, and it wouldn’t
undermine any sense of choice for a real woman.

However, it didn’t feel authentic to me.  Plus, now that Way of
Kings Prime is out, you all can know that a relationship with a man
(Taln) was a plot point to her initial characterization.  (I can’t say
that I’ll stick with this, to be honest.  It will depend on a ton of
factors.)

When I discussed all this all with a good friend of mine who is
far more involved in feminist discourse and the LGBTQIA+ community, she
suggested that I make Jasnah bisexual or biromantic.  I resisted this
because I knew the only planned relationship I had for her was with a
man, and it felt disingenuous to try to imply this is how I see her.
(Though, in your head canon, there’s certainly great arguments for
this.)  The problem is that Shallan is leaning very bi as I’ve written
her more, but she’s in a relationship with a man.  I don’t know if
this is a big issue in fiction, but it would feel somehow wrong to for
me to write a bunch of bisexual characters who all only engaged in
relationships with people of the opposite gender.  It feels I could do
more damage than good by trying to pretend I’m being inclusive in this
way, without actually giving true representation.

This all might beg another question: will there be other characters in
the Stormlight Archive (or cosmere) who are LGBTQIA+.  Yes. (Including
major viewpoint characters.)  However, I worry that by talking too
much about that here, I would imply a tone where I’m trying too hard
to deflect.  (One person I chatted with about this warned me not to
send the “wrong message that queer characters are like representation
tokens that we can exchange for each other for equal credit.”  I found
that a very astute piece of advice.)

I am quite happy with Jasnah’s depiction in this book, and while
I’m sorry she can’t be everything everyone wanted, I’m excited for her
development as a character in the back five books.  My promise to you
remains the same: to make the Cosmere a place where I explore all
aspects of the human experience.  And a place that represents not just
me, but as many different types of peoples and beliefs as I
can--depicted the best I can as vibrant, dynamic characters.

Many thanks to those in the LGBTQIA+ community who have written to
me with suggestions, criticisms, and support.  And thanks to everyone
for being patient with me, and this series, as I continue to shape it.",mistborn,Reddit,Positive,0.14654115226337444

2022-04-27 22:24:32,"Sexy Sect Babes: Chapter Eleven An was doing something she normally hated.

Reading.

**E = mc².**

The words on the page before her stood out, for it was a line that was as profound as any meditations on the nature of existence as any she had ever read. Yet it was surprisingly grounded.

Preceding that line were pages upon pages of mathematical formulae and observations of the world. An could freely admit that much of it went over her head.

But that line stuck with her.

**E = mc².**

Her brain had seized upon it – once she had realized the barest implications of what it suggested.

**Energy equals mass times the speed of light squared**.

That her master somehow knew the speed of *light* was irrelevant compared to the great knowledge held within. Mass and energy were one and the same - and thus, held within the very flesh of her smallest finger was supposedly enough energy to devastate an entire city a dozen times over were it to be unleashed.

*Or at least, that is what this disciple believes,* she thought as she scrunched her nose, peering down at the incredibly verbose text.

That was what it was saying, right?

*Maybe?* She frowned. *Possibly?*

The cultivator shook her head, as her temples began to pound from too long deliberating the overly verbose scripture beneath her.

Sighing, she looked up towards the cloudy skies above - her view unimpeded by her position atop the great wall surrounding Jiangshi.

*Is this a boon or not?* she wondered.

She supposed she shouldn’t have been too surprised that her master was a student of natural philosophy rather than the more… violent practices. Nor the more esoteric. For while his constructions were fantastical to look upon, for everything she had seen there had been an underlying logic behind it.

What logic that was, she could not even begin to guess, but it was impossible to gaze upon those works and not see the patterns. A lifetime poring through the dusty techniques and cultivation methods of ancient masters allowed her to garner that much. Which was also why she could see that her master worked with the world rather than raging against it. He sought out the rules of existence and then exploited them.

…As evidenced by the painstaking observations below her. No one but a natural philosopher would bother to jot down such elaborate notes otherwise.

She huffed.

Natural philosophy was a known, if uncommon – and oft considered outdated - form of cultivation. After all, for all that cultivation was about the act of imposing one’s own Dao upon the world, some earlier scholars had suggested that an understanding of said world could serve to accelerate the process of learning to change it.

Modern consensus was that this was a flawed approach, one that weakened one's Dao by preemptively admitted weakness.

*Yet…*

**If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.**

Another inspired teaching, from the other book her master had provided. One on methods of making war, and something she found much more palatable to her sensibilities.

She was a warrior first and foremost after all.

She ran her fingers across the perfectly smooth writing. No doubt another product of her master’s mystic machines.

Yes. Her teacher was not a warrior by nature. He was a crafter. This town his latest project.

Some might have derided such a path as foolish. She would call them fools in turn. Not all legends of the Empire were warriors. For every Scarlet Blade, their was an Ully the Craftsmen. So long as one followed one's Dao, there was no shame in the path they took. All roads lead to divinity to long as they were followed seriously.

And so long as she attempted to learn, she would improve her own Dao by being in the presence of a master.

…Though she would admit, that she might have been a little more leery of doing so if said master were not a rather attractive man.

Ignoring the heat that stained her cheeks, her thoughts ran unbidden to the village girl. She’d returned to her master’s home a few times since that first meeting. Each time she had left unruffled, with no signs of carnal relations.

Her master claimed he enjoyed her company.

He was a strange man. What possible amusement could he derive from the uneducated ramblings of a rural peasant?

“…If he required conversation, This Guo An would be happy to provide it,” she muttered.

Alas, he kept her at arm's length, their relationship strictly master and student. And even then, sometimes she felt more like a *subordinate* than a student.

He had only provided the books she currently held upon request.

*What books they are though,* she thought, running her fingers across the leather covers.

She shook her head. Such profound wisdom only reinforced her decision to follow him.

“Troop, pivot right!”

The sudden call had her glancing out towards the clearing outside the wall. The mortal militia was practicing as usual. Ostensibly, she was watching over them as they did.

The mortals had improved a lot in the last few weeks. Now, when the sergeants called out, the formation moved as one. Like some manner of massive hedgehog. In moments, the entire group had shifted about, presenting a veritable forest of spear points in a new direction.

It was a queer way to fight. One she could scarcely fathom tolerating. The mortals were pressed so tightly together that one would be unable to swing a sword or even dodge if the needed to. The tight press of bodies were as much a prison as they were a shield.

It was like nothing she’d ever seen. Not even the relatively ""elite"" mortal guards of the city’s fought as her master’s new militia did. Oh certainly, the city guard could march in formation if needed. It was for show though. A display of discipline and power on the part of the sects that bankrolled them.

They certainly didn’t fight like that. Doing so would only serve to make them a more tempting target for a cultivator.

At least she was not the only one who found this new form of warfare strange. On more than one occasion she had glimpsed the former guards of Ten-Huo reading late into the night from books that possessed a remarkable similarity to her own gifted tomes.

“Forward!” Gao’s unmistakable voice carried across the dew laden ground.

Not a single one of the troops moved. They’d long since learned the importance of ignoring any order that was not preceded by ‘troop’.

Grinning, Gao was just about to shout again when a great ringing came from one of wall bells. One that was just a little close for An’s liking as her ears peeled back against her head at the rising cacophony.

Shaking off her discomfort, her gaze turned towards the nearby forest in search of what had spooked the wall watchman.

With her enhanced senses, it took but a moment for her to catch sight of the trio of mountain goats and two deer prowling around the forest edge. An frowned. After the initial attack on Jiangshi, the beasts had started arriving as individuals or pairs instead of a massive horde. That had changed recently though. Now they were arriving in clumps ranging anywhere from three to ten beasts.

More to the point, they had changed.

One of the goats she was staring at was far bigger than it had any right to be. Its form bulged with powerful muscles. Likewise, its horns had taken on a distinctly more ominous shape. Thicker, sharper and more angular, the thick growths now looked more than up to the task of goring a man to death.

Yet it wasn’t a spirit beast. Even from here, An could sense that.

*…But it’s close,* she thought.

She made no move to intervene as the group of corrupted animals broke from the treeline to charge at the mass of mortals.

Whatever the Great Enemy were doing to the animals of the Empire, it was new.

She watched with subdued interest as the massive creatures rushed at the mortal formation – and were swiftly impaled on innumerable spikes.

*That’s fine.* She smiled. *We have new tricks too.*

That smile only grew as the bell nearby rang again. She didn’t need it though. She’d immediately sensed the arrival of the newcomer.

A spirit beast.

Her smile grew ever more feral as she stood up, grabbing her glaive as she did.

Learning was all well and good, but she was a woman of action. She lived for the thrill of battle. More to the point, she’d nearly processed the spirit core of the wolf. Her Ki had grown by leaps and bounds. Already she could feel herself pushing into the very precipice of stage three of the Initiate realm.

She just needed a little more to push over the edge.

And the great hawk that darted across the skies around Jiangshi would do nicely.

Swollen to nearly the size of a horse, the massive bird was focused on the militia. It was trying to figure out how to get around the sea of spikes toward the men inside the formation.

It was struggling though.

An couldn’t help but feel some pride at that. The men below her would have all cut and run once when faced with a spirit beast. And she wouldn’t have blamed them for doing so. By fleeing, the majority would have escaped while the beast fed on the unlucky few who didn’t.

Such was the cold calculus of frontier life.

With her master’s training though it was actually safer within the formation. And the mortals knew it. Which was why not a one broke formation as the hawk swooped down at them repeatedly, searching for a gap in their ranks.

One that the militia were determined not to provide. For good reason.

It was actually a rather impressive display. Even An herself might have needed to think hard about attempting to surge past their united front.

For a time at least. Eventually she’d get in.

Still, as she leapt from the wall and into the fray, An could only concede that her master really was a genius.

He’d somehow managed to make even mortals useful!

*Great results can be achieved with small forces,* she thought, thinking back to an earlier quote from this mysterious scholar ‘Sun Tzu’.

\-------------

Kang slumped his head against the table – though he was careful to make sure the book was well out of the way when he did. Even if a good chunk of the contents of the tome were beyond him.

Much to his frustration.

Oh, how he wished he’d never laid eyes on his copy of *Medieval Pike Tactics*.

What was frustrating, was that the stuff he didn’t understand *worked.* Empress above, how it worked. He’d thought they were going to lose half the training group when that great bastard of a hawk swooped down on them.

It was all he could do to keep bellowing commands rather than soil himself in terror.

No one had died though. The militia had somehow managed to hold a spirit beast at bay.

He could still scarcely believe it.

Which was why it made it all the more frustrating that a number of the concepts being raised by the book in front of him went beyond his own limited understanding of this new way of fighting. Something he knew was echoed in the mind of his fellow ‘officers’.

Some days he could only thank the Empress that the recruits were so terrified of him and his fellows that they didn’t realize that sometimes they were being given contradictory instructions.

*…Or they think we’re messing with them,* Kang supposed.

Still, they *were* making progress in figuring out this new form of warfare. Whatever else Kang was, he wasn’t an idiot. He’d been soldiering his entire life. He was accustomed to commanding men in battle and in peace. If anyone could turn the words on these pages into a working stratagem, it was him.

He owed the hidden master that much.

Surreptitiously, he glanced around the barracks – though it was really just a recently vacated home – and knew that all of the others felt the same.

“Anyone know what a ‘shot’ is?” Gao asked suddenly.

“What?” Another man prompted.

Gao raised his book. “Here, it mentions the stuff we’re doing now eventually being replaced by ‘pike and shot’. I know what a pike is, so what the fuck’s a shot?”

*Replaced?* Kang couldn’t help but ponder.

He shook his head. It didn’t matter. The books the master had provided often mentioned strange names, places and events. It was clear it came from far away. Either some distant part of the Empire, or perhaps even an entirely different continent?

It wasn’t his concern. His focus was on implementing what was directly in front of him.

“It might be some kind of sling? Or bow?” Kang suggested.

“What’s a sling?” Gao asked.

Kang sighed.

*City boys,* he thought.

\---------

Guns were hard. Almost as hard as cultivation.

Jack had asked An about it. Sure, he’d had to hide the fact that he was learning about it by pretending he was asking about her own process, but it had worked. An had been all too happy to talk. At length.

Turned out, becoming a punch wizard was hard. Real hard. Time consuming too. To him, it seemed that cultivation was less a vocation and more a lifestyle. Before you were anything else, you were a cultivator. Because cultivation required daily meditation. Hours of practice. The equivalent of a small fortune in performance in enhancing drugs.

Sure, An had called them reagents, but he knew what mystical doping was when he heard it.

So yeah, whatever thoughts he might have entertained of becoming a cultivator himself had promptly fled after that conversation. To be frank, even if he had the willpower to essentially live the lifestyle of an Olympic athlete, it was an inefficient use of his limited time. Instead, he’d be better served leveraging his unique advantages to build up a high-tech army, rather than let himself become another strictly average – or even subpar - wizard.

It was a shame, but he’d just have to make do with his gene-forged body and technology so advanced it might as well have been magic.

*Poor me,* he lamented sarcastically.

…Were that guns weren’t also like magic.

*Poor me,* he lamented legitimately.

Oh sure, they were simple in theory. While he’d never actually seen an old slug-thrower outside of old movies, he knew of the concept. Unlike the masers he was more familiar with, slug-throwers functioned by using a small explosive charge to propel an equally small chunk of metal – or lead, if those movies were to be believed – down a long tube at high speed.

It sounded simple enough. More to the point, it was well within his means. He had tubes. He had small chunks of metal. He had explosive powders.

“Fuck,” he hissed as another gun exploded in his hands.

He couldn’t help flinching every time it happened. Sure, his suit protected him from any damage, but the tactile feedback system in his hands gave him a small jolt to inform him that something *had* exploded in his hands.

He tossed the vaguely flower shaped chunk of metal away in disgust.

“Test batch twenty eight. Failure.” He spat.

He glanced over at the growing pile of exploded tubes sitting in the corner. Ok, that was an exaggeration. Not all of them had exploded. Hell, most hadn’t. Only recently had things escalated to explosions.

*Or cracks,* he thought, running a hand along a seam in one of them.

It was to be expected, even if it was frustrating. He was still trying to figure out the best ratios if he was going get as much bang for his buck as possible without compromising the barrel of the gun.

Overkill? Perhaps.

Still, he was dealing with magic animals and iron skinned punch wizards. An average musket ball would probably only annoy a lot of them. In that situation, he figured it was better to err on the side of overkill rather than have his people watch their shots literally bounce off of whatever – or whoever – they were shooting at.

To that end, he needed something with lots of stopping power.

*Hence, my growing pile of exploded gun barrels,* he thought as he picked up the next untested barrel. *And even once I get this figured out, I need to figure out a decent firing mechanism…*

That would be a pain. A pain involving lots of small clicky parts.

This was not his area of expertise, predominantly because he didn’t have one. Sure, he used an advanced mining rig, but it wasn’t like they were complex to operate. They were simple by design: all the better to supply to the kind of dumb morons who were stupid enough to sign up with the Canary Corp.

Which was why he’d already decided he was going for a break action design. He had neither the time nor inclination to figure out magazines.

Perhaps that might change later, but for now, his focus was on just getting guns out there.

At least, his people seemed disciplined enough now that he was unduly worried about them blowing their own toes off when he finally supplied the ‘real’ weapons to them.

*Though I’ll probably need to figure out proper bullets too,* he thought glancing at the nearby barrel of smokeless powder.

He was less than inclined towards having his people lug around large barrels of gun powder for every battle. Not where people with actual magic were concerned. An had said that the leader of the nearby city could apparently chuck lightning around, and if she could do that Jack was sure there’d be someone else who could summon fire out there too.

It was just that kind of world.

*So… bullets.* He decided. *Which I think use… flint. Somehow.*

He slumped. It seemed he’d need to rewatch the same forty odd seconds of an old documentary on repeat another dozen times, because those forty odd seconds involved a very handy animated graphic of a gun’s inner workings.

*Until then though,* he thought, dumping more powder into the tube in his hands. *I’ve got to blow up more perfectly serviceable gun barrels.*

2024-08-26 15:01:01,"Marika is (literally) a Philosopher’s Stone and I’ve got receipts It’s no secret that Elden Ring heavily draws on alchemical concepts to build the world. You can’t even talk about the game without inadvertently mentioning some idea directly tied to the alchemical arts. For a while I ran under the assumption that this was a symbolic connection created by GRRM to build some structure to the events of the world. However, recently I stumbled upon [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/rxkp3t/alchemy_and_elden_ring_melania_and_radahn/) from prior to the game’s release which mentioned the Ripley Scrolls and how they related to the game trailer. While I think the original poster was seemingly off base on a few assumptions, now that we have tons of new info from the game and the DLC I think he was absolutely right to connect the Ripley Scrolls to the game. Major props to u/Parasoulsus ([what a topical name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus)) for making this connection *before the game even came out*.

After poring over these scrolls, I’ve reached the conclusion that Marika’s journey is not constructed as an allegory for the alchemical stages, but is instead Marika directly and *literally* proceeding through the stages of the Magnum Opus, or Great Work, thus creating and becoming the Philosopher’s Stone. Much like alchemical practitioners in the Middle Ages, her final goal in this is to create, in a fashion, the Elixir of Life, putting an end to death. We know this as the removal of the Rune of Death, the sealing of Destined Death.

# ~ The Ripley Scrolls ~

These documents (I’m just going to call them “the Scrolls” from here on) are divided into a few sections. Looking at these illustrations provides us with a frankly unignorable amount of parallels to Elden Ring, to the point that I believe this document was absolutely used as a reference when creating the game’s world.

There are twenty one known copies of the Ripley Scrolls, and since they were made over hundreds of years no two are exactly the same. [Here is a link](https://www.christies.com/lot/lot-the-ripley-scroll-an-illustrated-alchemical-manuscript-6118860/?lid=1&from=relatedlot&intobjectid=6118860) to a set of photos of the copy I used as a reference for this post. I’ll also include images of relevant sections in the text as needed.

The main sections of the Ripley Scrolls each illustrate one the three stages of the Magnum Opus: Nigredo, Albedo, and Rubedo. The goal of each stage is to produce the corresponding stone; the Black Stone from Nigredo; the White Stone from Albedo; and the Red Stone from Rubedo. Combining these three stones produces the Philosopher’s Stone and completes The Great Work.

[Stages are almost always represented via color, but also by various personifications](https://preview.redd.it/f647v07w9xkd1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=658e4ae2e00f063081b14f098d9a0cb996a87547)

# Nigredo

>“All alchemical ingredients had to be cleansed and cooked extensively to a uniform black matter.”

The first stage of the process begins with the preparation and melding of the reagents. This was done by cooking until all became a black sludge referred to as putrescence, and then waiting until the product had started to rot and decompose. For this reason, Nigredo is heavily tied to decay and putrefaction. The product of Nigredo is the Black Stone, the first of the three components of the Philosopher’s Stone. The Ripley Scrolls, as with many European occult writings, link toads with death and decay. Nigredo is thus represented by the toad that is very clearly pissing buckets at the beginning of the scroll.

[Be happy that it’s piss. In the other copies it’s blood.](https://preview.redd.it/angh63jcaxkd1.png?width=475&format=png&auto=webp&s=b37a7ef8f90217b9e93b5d09ed7ed8025941badb)

In Elden Ring, while it is not a confirmed theory, there is solid evidence Numen formed from putrescence. Numen are said to have arrived to the Lands Between on boats, but we see notably few actual ships. Instead, there is a repeated tie between death and water. Our boy the Tibia Marina is the only licensed ship pilot in the entire Lands Between, and the only aquatic vehicle we ever take or see is a stone coffin that ferries us over waterfalls. Coupled with the fact that the coffins in the Stone Coffin Fissure that leak the putrescence are shaped like ocean-going vessels, there is a strong indication that coffins in this world serve double duty as boats, ferrying the dead across the water much like Charon across the River Styx. Our character even starts the game waking up amidst a pile of coffins just below a cave opening by the coast. Given these points, the theory states that Numen came to the Lands Between in those large ship-coffins as corpses, forming from the ooze that leaked out. This means that Marika, whose race forms from the uniform black sludge we know as putrescence, *is* the Black Stone, as are all Numen. 

I think this is the one notable leap I take in my theory, as there’s absolutely a chance this assumption is incorrect. However, even were the Numen coffin origin theory to be incorrect, Nigredo is still present in the jarring process: the diseased tooth whips were used to flay the skin of Shamans, as it was necessary for all materials to rot and decompose before they could meld harmoniously in the alchemist’s jars. I find this connection to be a bit weaker than the putrescence theory but still valid for establishing Nigredo as a step in Marika’s journey to godhood.

# Albedo 

[Albedo](https://preview.redd.it/9dzh239ux0ld1.png?width=625&format=png&auto=webp&s=18cbea3dcbd25eca7468da7a4fd2322d70da2f5a)

The second stage, often known as *ablutio,* or the “washing away of impurities”, is intended to produce the White Stone. The drawing of this stage is presented as eight encircled scenes, or roundels, with each roundel portraying a step of Albedo. A fun fact of note is that the glass jar that these roundels are encompassed by is called a crucible. Functionally similar to a crucible used in smithing, it is meant to hold materials together without sealing them from the outside world and is a crucial piece of any alchemist’s lab. Crucibles also hold symbolic meaning, representing a microcosm of the greater universe in which the alchemist’s experiment takes place. The usage of “crucible” and “microcosm” are not my own, but instead show up in a number of sources on the matter. The microcosm especially is quite common as a concept across tons of alchemy sources and seems to be a core concept of the process. You may recall that those terms are present in Elden Ring as well, an inclusion that I presume to be an intentional nod towards their alchemical parallels.

Ripley’s Scrolls eight roundels detail the process:

[A man and a women are maimed with axe and spear beneath a tree as a serpent watches. Reminiscent of the “O, Mother” tree in Bonnie Village, especially given the discarded snakeskin found nearby the site.](https://preview.redd.it/77p5aymwcxkd1.png?width=435&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bee2432d42175addc552796182f61bcba4a996e)

[The man and woman are forced into a jar\/alembic to “distill”.  The doves are symbolic of the third element besides the body and soul - the spirit. While body and soul are mentioned often in Elden Ring, I’ve found little mention of this other piece of the trinity.](https://preview.redd.it/5n5bj1wzcxkd1.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=3393e1c53421a4972b6a48ce44f86b8304450c4e)

[Distillation produces a soul that is the white stone \(albedo\/Jar-Saint Marika\). Note that the bodies remain in the jar, but the soul is released.](https://preview.redd.it/qmujp391dxkd1.png?width=447&format=png&auto=webp&s=bb12c540666472ade6bd85688bb52c4ad3c3938d)

[The released soul forms a new physical being. It also appears that the remaining five steps of this process produces a new body that is the fusion of the man and woman. It’s not clear what this implies for the Scrolls’ presentation of the Magnus Opus \(historical alchemy docs are notoriously vague in order to “protect the secrets of the art”\), but it gives us an alternate possibility for Radagon’s origin, which I’ll discuss in a bit.](https://preview.redd.it/dues6rxcdxkd1.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=2288fe82368b4e4a75baf21224f6d11f6e9721d8)

# Citrinitas 

This step is not present in the Scrolls’ depiction of The Work. See notes for details and discussion.

# Rubedo 

From the [*\~Atalanta Fugiens\~*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta_Fugiens) Emblem XXI :

>“Make of a man and woman a circle; then a quadrangle; out of this a triangle; make again a circle, and you will have the Stone of the Wise. Thus is made the stone, which thou canst not discover, unless you, through diligence, learn to understand this geometrical teaching.

>…

>In like manner the Philosophers would have the quadrangle reduced into a triangle, that is, into **Body**, **Spirit**, and **Soul**, which three do appear in three previous colors before redness, for example, the body or earth in the blackness of Saturn, the Spirit in a lunar whiteness, as water, the Soul or air in a solar citrinity: then will the triangle be perfect, but this likewise must be changed into a circle, that is, into an invariable redness: **By which operation the woman is converted into the man, and made one with him**, and the senary the first number of the perfect completed by one, two, having returned again to an unit, in which is eternal rest and peace.”

The final stage, known as Rubedo, is the fusion of all things into one; the creation of the Red Stone. The Red stone is considered the most “mature” stone, and its presence signifies the completion of The Great Work. Metaphorically, it is the fusion of male and female energies into a single entity, and is often represented symbolically by the crowning of a king. The Self manifests itself in ""wholeness,"" a point in which a person discovers their true nature. Another interpretation phrased it as ""reunification"" which entail the reunion of body, soul, and spirit, leading to a diminished inner conflict.

[Rubedo in its entirety](https://preview.redd.it/ely02qp4gxkd1.png?width=308&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d79bde74605d35a4ff19e22f8cbcc33e350bcac)

In Ripley Scrolls, the instructions for this stage are broken down into three segments.

**Segment One - The Mouth of the Collarick**

https://preview.redd.it/29yhae0rdxkd1.png?width=1032&format=png&auto=webp&s=c67ba77e2c07f5546938153fdc83d6ea7b1c821c

In the first segment, we’re presented with a flaming gate adorning the tree with the warning “*The mouth of the Collarick beware*”. Note that the gate’s location does not necessarily mean it is literally on top of the tree. Position on the scroll can be indicative of ordering (i.e. this part of the step must happen first since it is on top of the next), but also of physical position (i.e. this part of the step is *physically on top of* the next part), as we will see in later segments. It’s a bit of stylistic flair that comes with having a document that’s six feet long when fully unrolled and has to be read top to bottom. The text surrounding this gate reads:

>“*Of the sun take the light*  
*The red gum that is so bright*  
*And of the Moon do also*  
*The white gum they both throw*  
*The philosophers sulphur vive*  
*This I call it without strife*  
*Kybright and Kebright it is called also*  
*And other names many more*  
*Of them draw out a tincture*”

Not much to go on there, really. It states that the creation of the *sulphur vive* (one of the reagents needed for the Philosopher’s Stone) comes from taking parts of the Sun and the Moon. Generally Sun and Moon are used to represent male and female energies, so this is stating that man and woman must be melded into one to produce the Red Stone. However, there is another copy of the Scrolls which adds to this section:

>“***And make of them a marriage pure***  
***Between the husband and the wife***  
***Espoused with the water of life***  
*But of this water thou must beware*  
*Or else thy work will be full bare*  
*He must be made of his own kind*  
*Mark thou now in thy mind”*

With this added context, the Mouth of the Collarick certainly resembles the Divine Gate in Enir Elim, although it looks like this one required way less mass murder to build. Its position as the portal between albedo and rubedo is also perfectly at home with the idea that Marika emerges from the jarring as the White Stone, as she must pass through the divine gate to begin Rubedo on her path to forming a Philosopher’s Stone.

**Segment  Two - The Golden Tree and Holy Shit Wait is This Actually Real?**

https://preview.redd.it/k8gkvv8zfxkd1.png?width=385&format=png&auto=webp&s=1841d98b11485f43d0bdbadb1b2afbd9656261d2

The second segment presents us with a tree of gold in the middle of a lake, mounted by a golden beast. The tree is tended to by a man and woman, with the ama - ""vessel"" in latin - in the tree with the beast. This tier of the structure is surrounded by seven pillars, each with a figure holding a flask atop it. These figures likely represent the seven alchemical principles (also referred to as the seven classical planets or seven classical metals). It’s fitting, then, that this closely depicts the seven thrones of the Golden Order in Leyndell. This was also mentioned in the original post by u/Parasoulsus and has its own fun little rabbit hole to go down, with implications about how the demigods and the outer gods fit into everything.

[Seven thrones, seven pillars, seven classical elements, seven classical planets](https://preview.redd.it/z4zvexcwdxkd1.png?width=962&format=png&auto=webp&s=80047979dd8665d67ed1a75283e39a531f68b6b9)

I have not been able to decipher the meaning of the golden beast with relation to the Scrolls, but the visuals of the tree and beast surrounded by a lake, tended by the man and woman are shockingly similar to Leyndell and the Erdtree. The symbolism of the golden beast is unclear, though; in other copies of the document this beast is not gold, and instead appears as a woman with a lizard’s tail and webbed feet. The tail in those versions especially shares visual themes with a certain tail incantation and the misbegotten.

[Big Crucible energy \(BCE\)](https://preview.redd.it/na5577hefxkd1.png?width=1326&format=png&auto=webp&s=b33c1c2303053b590348c269444bec8b59d6e8c0)

All of this sits upon a sturdy pillar supported by a golden giant. The man and woman stand nearby, and all are surrounded by \*gouldne water\* (golden water) and the four Classical Elements of alchemy: Fire, earth, air, and water, the materials which make up all things. We can see reflections of this depiction in the game: the Elden Beast at the base of the tree, supporting it; the lake of gold that makes up his arena, surrounded by similarly gold pillars much like the one the beast holds up. 

Note just how similar all of the Rubedo images look to Leyndell, even across different versions of the scrolls. 

https://preview.redd.it/2t8ba6difxkd1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=ce2ff25a11e9c3f80c932f40a03c9e93586f4bac

**Segment  Three - The Dragon Below**

https://preview.redd.it/aa3r7w7sfxkd1.png?width=698&format=png&auto=webp&s=98d629fee601fc0d82c7e3d0890fda13c320f34d

The third and final piece of the Rubedo section is an odd one. A dragon, described as the Dragon Grimm, devours the toad we saw representing Nigredo. The accompanying text is quite interesting:

>“*On the Ground there is a Hill,*  
*Also a Serpent within a Well:*  
*His Tayle is long with Wings wide,*  
*All ready to fly on every side,*  
*Repair the Well round about,*  
*That the Serpent pas not out;*  
*For if that he be there agone,*  
*Thou loosest the vertue of the Stone,*  
*What is the Ground thou mayst know heere,*  
*And also the Well that is so clear:*  
*And eke the Serpent with his Tayle*  
*Or else the work shall little availle,*  
*The Well must bring in Water cleare,*  
*Take good heed for this thy Fyre,*  
*The Fire with Water burnt shall be,*  
*And Water with Fire wash shall he;*  
*Then Earth on Fire shall be put,*  
*And Water with Air shall be knit,*  
*Thus ye shall go to Putrefaccion,*  
*And bring the Serpent to reduction.*  
*First he shall be Black as any Crow,*  
*And downe in his Den shall lye full lowe:*  
*Swell'd as a toad that lyeth on ground,*  
*Burst with bladders fitting so round,*  
*They shall to brast and lye full plaine,*  
*And thus with craft the Serpent is slaine:*  
*He shall shew Collours there many a one,*  
*And turn as White as wilbe the bone,*  
*With the water that he was in,*  
*Wash him clean from his sin:*  
*And let him drink a little and a lite,*  
*And that shall make him faire and white,*  
*The which whiteness is ever abiding,*  
*Lo here is the very full finishing:*  
*Of the White Stone and the Red,*  
*Lo here is the true deed.*”

There are some odd implications here that I’ll go over in my thoughts on what all this means for the timeline. But suffice to say, it is crucial that this winged serpent in the well must be contained there to complete Rubedo. 

# The Elixir of Life

One of the most important outcomes of the creation of the Philosopher’s Stone is the formation of the *Elixir Vitae* - The Elixir of Life. It grants eternal life and regeneration to those it blesses. In Elden Ring, this is analogous to the breaking of the rune of death. In the Scrolls, it is depicted as the Bird of Hermes, who plucks at his own feathers.

[This anxiety chicken has given me more headaches than it has any right to](https://preview.redd.it/r7sqnqmdgxkd1.png?width=479&format=png&auto=webp&s=ee15b3ef22f6629bdb6c9c66676e593099694d90)

I’ve had a hell of a time trying to put together how the imagery here ties to anything in the game. There’s no guarantee that GRRM stuck to the full process, but given that the Ripley Scrolls are extremely explicit about what follows Rubedo, it’s hard to imagine that there isn’t a connection.

[Rubedo ends and there’s not even a water break before we’re getting rid of death](https://preview.redd.it/masj19vlgxkd1.png?width=1444&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5dbdf73b506bfcd08a8ebed32fdab51f2188e1a)

Given the significance of this step - the Elixir of Life/removal of death is the entire point of this whole shitshow - you’d expect that there’d be some shared imagery between the Scrolls and the game, but birds are notably underrepresented in Elden Ring despite having important symbolic value in alchemical teachings. Feel free to speculate on this in the comments.

As I see it, all of this evidence, while not conclusive, is at least pretty solid. And even better, it allows us to construct a timeline of sorts due to the ordering of the process. So let's build out a timeline using the Ripley Scrolls as a framework and see what we get. Some of this is theoretical, but it doesn’t feel like any of it requires much of a mental stretch to fit into what we know so far:

# Nigredo

The coffin boats arrive at the Lands Between. Over time, they begin to leak their putrescent contents which, much like the Putrescent Knight guarding St. Trina’s resting place, form into beings that eventually become the Numen. I assume that Marika wasn’t one of the first and was born later, but I don’t really have evidence either way and it doesn’t matter too much to the conclusions drawn here. The Numen's formation from corpse goo establishes every one of them as a Black Stone, the initial component of the Philosopher’s Stone.

[Remember this guy? That’s every Numen. Just a rotting toad pissing buckets.](https://preview.redd.it/z59rz2qrgxkd1.png?width=231&format=png&auto=webp&s=9fdbc2dc89ce9da1e5b48ddd7e921c2fbb95321a)

# Albedo

Marika and some other person, potentially Radagon or just another random unfortunate, are taken to the tree at Bonny Village, whipped and maimed, and then jarred together. The presence of the snake skin at the tree further supports the connection to this stage, as evidenced by the tree snake in the first of the Albedo roundels. The jarred people slowly ferment and produce Jar-Saint Marika (an ascended soul that is the White Stone). It is also possible that this produces the fused body of Marika/the other jaree, which becomes Radagon, but I haven’t found other documentation detailing what happens to the fused bodies according to alchemical lore. Still, it’s not impossible given the evidence presented so far, and it slots neatly into the rest of the timeline as well. At this point, the ascension through the Gate of Divinity is not Marika attaining true godhood, but a lesser version of it. This is in line with the White Stone being viewed as a “less mature” Red Stone. This would also explain why Marika didn’t just fix everything with a snap of her fingers the instant she ascended through the Gate and instead had to wage a brutal war against the Hornsent.

# Citrinitas

**(See Citrinitas in notes section below for details on this extra step in the process)**

The banishment of the Nox underground is representative of Marika no longer needing the light of the moon, from an alchemical standpoint. This would also insinuate that Radagon’s marriage to Rennala was meant to achieve the union of Moon and Sun prior to this, but with the timeline still unclear it’s hard to rely on these events happening in that order.

Supporting the linking of that marriage to the requirements of the Magnum Opus is this description from the *Universal und Particularia*, one of the copies of the Scrolls:

>“*Be there in the conjunction*  
*Of the moon and of sun*  
*After the marriage be begun*  
*And all the while they be a wedding*  
*Give to them their drinking*  
*Acetone that is good and fine*  
*Better to them then any wine*  
*Now when this marriage is done.*  
*Philosophers call it a stone.*”

In any case, evidence surrounding this stage is tenuous at best. The Nox clearly link the moon to silver (a fundamental alchemical concept), and Rennalla and the Carian’s ties to the moons are blatantly obvious, so who knows? Either way, there’s not enough to go on right now so I’m just as ready to say Citrinitas wasn’t involved in GRRM’s alchemical model. This section of my post is just to get the ideas out there.

# Rubedo

Having ascended as the White Stone, Marika sets about creating the conditions necessary to complete Rubedo and form the Red Stone. The Erdtree is created (whether this is by taking pure elements from the Scadutree or by replacing the Scadutree with the Erdtree I have no idea and do not speculate on). The banishment of the Land of Shadow remains a big fat question mark, but it may be tied to the towers surrounding the tree and lake seen in the Rubedo section of the Scrolls. They are remarkably similar to the Divine Towers, which clearly had a role in the banishment as they border the region where the Lands of Shadow used to be. 

Finally, Marika and Radagon marry and fuse into one, joining man and woman into oneness. If we’re following the theory mentioned in the Albedo section that Radagon is the body produced from jarring and Marika is the soul, this is also where the soul and body become whole again, a crucial component of Rubedo. In doing this, she completes the Magnus Opus and forms the Philosopher’s Stone. 

There is also an implication from the text about the Dragon Grimm that Marika may have trapped the Elden Beast underground as a necessary step to completing this stage:

>“*Also a Serpent within a Well:*  
*His tayle is long with Wings wide,*  
*All ready to fly on every side,*  
*Repair the Well round about,*  
*That the Serpent pass not out;*  
*For if that he be there agone,*  
*Thou loosest the virtue of the Stone,”*

If we follow this interpretation, it explains why Leyndell was built upon a lake: it serves as a container for the lake/well, as a prison for the Elden Beast. For if the Serpent escapes, the Work fails and the Philosopher’s Stone is ruined.

**The Elixir of Life and Marika’s Motivations**

Having completed the Work and attained true godhood, Marika achieves her original goal that she wished for as a girl to the Grandmother - she destroys the Rune of Death so that no one else has to die like those she knew growing up. This is her Elixir of Life: no more death, endless regeneration. Much like Miquella, I believe Marika’s goal started as a child’s naive wish to improve the world and slowly morphed into a series of atrocities and horrors, which is a common transformation for any aspiring alchemist.

What follows is the consequences of the feat. Her children, born cursed, are never granted escape through death. Malenia rots eternally, for the decay can never claim her. Godwyn is murdered, but his body is never able to die and festers like an infection on the land. Messmer and Melina burn endlessly. The realization that her great efforts to improve the world have created nothing but pain push her to set in motion the events that bring us to The Lands Between; Marika banishes the Tarnished with the promise that they will return, then shatters the Elden Ring. She hopes that someone can undo what she’s done and kill her, which is why she curses Hewg to create a godslaying weapon.

# Interesting Notes

**Citrinitas, the other third stage**

Citrinitas is occasionally added as a step between Albedo and Rubedo. In most cases it is omitted or treated as an extension of Albedo. It is generally associated with orange or yellow and tied to the Sun.

[The four stages with Citrinitas sat between the White and Red Stones](https://preview.redd.it/falsdq5aixkd1.jpg?width=300&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=35a3059e371a8accb74522ea4c7874a27960b21b)

From [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrinitas:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citrinitas:)

>“In alchemical philosophy, Citrinitas stood for the dawning of the ""solar light"" inherent in one's being, and that the reflective ""lunar or soul light"" was no longer necessary.”

This is oddly reminiscent of the banishment of the Nox underground. I won’t talk too much about this, as it’s not present in the Scrolls, but I found the Nox banishment to be an interesting connection here given how directly the Golden Order and Eternal Cities parallel the sun and moon.

**Jarring - Shouldn’t it be tied to Rubedo?**

Initially it seemed like the jarring would be associated with the Rubedo stage, as it is a literal fusion of a woman and (probably) a man who is (probably) Radagon. However, this line spoken by Marika indicates that Rubedo must have occurred later:

>""*O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god. Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self.""*

This line always threw me. If Marika and Radagon were one at this point, how could he still not be a god? And if they weren’t yet fused, why does she refer to him as her “other self”? I chalked it up to a marital term at the time, but under the “Marika = Soul, Radagon = Body” theory the meaning is notably different. Radagon has not fused with Marika, but is still Marika in the sense that he is the body and she is the soul; the White Stone and the body that remains, both products of Albedo. “Let us be shattered” means “let us lose who we each are individually and become something new”, which is a full and complete god.

**Is the elden beast the thing in the tree or the dragon underneath the city?** 

I honestly don’t know. The gold may just be an idiosyncrasy added by the author of this specific copy, as the creature in the tree isn’t always depicted in that color. As mentioned before, it sometimes appears as a woman or man with an animal’s body parts, such as a long lizard tail or webbed feet. 

If we treat the gold as a quirk of this copy instead of the canonical representation, it doesn’t clear up what the beast in the tree is, but it does more clearly define the Dragon Grimm as the Elden Beast. The alternate depiction of the tree creature certainly shares visual similarities to the Misbegotten, but I don’t know what to make of that.

**The Other Sections of the Scrolls**

There are some other sections to the Scrolls that I’m not able to decipher enough to even weigh in on with regards to Elden Ring. The lions around the Mouth of Collarick after Rubedo certainly seem important, and there is a notable tie between lions and divinity in Elden Ring, but the meaning of the lions in the Scrolls doesn't cleanly translate to ER. The two lions in the Ripley Scrolls are *Leo Rubis* (Red Lion) and *Leo Verdis* (Green Lion). I've had no luck locating explanations of the value of the Red Lion, but the Green Lion is stated to be the lion who devoured the sun. As far as I know, there's no lion symbolism in Elden Ring that would fit that role. I also explored the idea that these lions act as as gatekeepers to the removal of death since the gate they guard stands between Rubedo and the Bird of Hermes, but again I've had no luck finding any justifiable recreations of this motif in the game. Serosh may play into it, or it may not be a part of the allegory.

The dragon eating its own tail while holding up the Sun, Moon, and the three Stones is vexing. It bleeds three streams upon the world, and I read in some random unreliable blog post that the blood from those streams was valued because it brought life, but there’s enough needless speculation as it is without introducing that kind of source. I’ll leave it up to you guys to delve into it, at least until I’ve done enough research to make another post on this line of thinking.

[Y'all got any ER lore about Dragon Blood?](https://preview.redd.it/a677b29thxkd1.png?width=364&format=png&auto=webp&s=25bcf60e43b74c2159988bceb729d6d9f91c4ec5)

The section at the end below said dragon I’m fairly certain is a depiction of the author, who is viewing all of this wisdom from Hermes. If that is the case, it’s just a cheeky self-add from the dude who made the scroll. Basically an alchemist shitpost.

**Why did Marika veil the Land of Shadow?**

I don’t honestly know, but the towers are mad suspect. Six-pointed shapes hold symbolic significance throughout alchemical works, and there are six divine towers. It doesn't necessarily *have* to tie in with the Magnus Opus, as she could have done it for other reasons e.g. hiding away Messmer's flame, but it does seem like a very big plot point to not get tied into this. I would expect all of the major events in Marika's ascension to tie to this theory in some way, so the Veiling is definitely a weak point in this line of thought with what we currently know.

**But isn't Marika the Rebis?**

The Rebis as a concept is essentially equivalent to the Philosopher's Stone. The differences are in the symbolic meaning that each represents. Both are the product of the Magnum Opus, and both are fusion of the male and female energy, but the Rebis is a spiritualistic representation of this product whereas the Philosopher's Stone is a physical one. The fact that there are two names is a result of two schools of alchemic thought - the spiritual and psychological school vs. the chemical and physical school. So if you'd like, read this post as saying ""Marika is literally the Rebis"" and you'll get the same value.

**Who is Elden John?**

Oh, weird that you’d ask that here but since you did, notice that dude up at the top of the Scrolls? That’s Hermes Trismegistus, the master alchemist and godlike figure of Hermeticism. In the Ripley Scrolls, he is the narrator and omniscient entity who guides us through the steps of the Magnus Opus. Elden John is Hermes Trismegistus. They both have long white beards and look pretty scholarly. I have no other evidence and rest my case.

2025-04-20 21:11:03,"Islam is false. Here's why Islam is false (from an ex-muslim)

The single strongest argument against Islam is probably that there is no strong argument for Islam in the first place.

Other arguments would be :

**1. Selling modesty in dunya, only to sell a hedonist paradise:**

Not trying to be disrespectful here but, the very way jannah is described, ""marble rounded non-saggy breasts"", ""big rounded eyes"", ""see through skin where you can see the bone marrow"" , ""pale-skin"" , hoors will remain virgins even after you have sex with them, etc does not seem to be coming from the God of the entire universe rather seems to be the fetishes of an Arab merchant in the 7th century.

**2. Cultic system:**

No free thought, rational queries allowed. Rational queries are allowed as far as you do not question the pillars of faith. ""Why does Allah always communicate with a Messenger?"", ""Was Muhamad really a prophet"", etc questions that target the core of Islam are full on discouraged.

Stuff like, ""Shaitan is misleading you"", ""Don't ask too many questions just submit"", ""Too much rationalization is bad"", ""Don't speak like a kaffir"" etc are the answers I got since my childhood whenever I had such questions. And why not? All these are answers Muhammad himself came up with when he could not answer stuff. And always ending the debate with ""Allah knows best ! "". Talk about skipping real queries.

**4. Fear of Allah and burning in hell forever:**

Any queries that doesn't get rational answers -- you are going to hell !! The fear mongering tactic pretty much paints a cultic approach of control.  
Quran is full of phrases like ""fear Allah"", ""he is the most merciful"", ""the disbelievers will burn in hell"".  
No matter what, I am supposed to fear this narcissistic God who made me just to worship him all the time! Like dude wtf ? At points in time, I even cursed myself, when I had questions because I thought if I let all these thoughts occur, than I will definitely roast in hell, cause I am not strong in my faith !!!

**5. The staggering evidence that points towards common ancestry:**

Shared endogenous retroviruses **(ERVs)** irrefutably proves the common ancestry between humans and apes. There are also other evidences from protein synthesis, fossil record, Genetic Homology and Synteny, Pseudogenes, mitochondrial DNA and Y-Chromosome diversity, Allelic Diversity and Population Genetics, Homologous Structures, Embryological Similarities, Molecular Clock Analysis, and I can go on and on with this list, trust me......

It's not a single piece of contested source of evidence. Its a whole lot of observable evidences from a whole lot of different disciplines that point towards a Common Ancestry. And therefore, this thing is uncontested in the field of evolution now.

I have looked into our popular Kent Hovind, and Subboor Ahmed as well who are the favourite anti macro-evolution propagandists on the block. And its laughable at most, cause the people they point at, were uncontested on Common Ancestry itself. Would not waste more time on this topic. Its a dead debate now.

But Allah the all knowing God not knowing about Evolution is Surprising innit!

**6. Permitting sex slavery and legalizing child marriage through a divine stamp:**

This is pretty much from the seerah, Quran and the hadees itself. Child marriages and sex slavery in Islam are permitted through divine commands. I would not go deep down the rabbit hole, to counter all the surface level claims of ""oh slaves were given food to eat and clothes to wear"", ""child marriage is just a product of the old times when lifespan used to be less"", etc bs.

I would just like to point out that, according to all the four schools of Islamic Jurisprudence in Sunni Islam, child marriages are legal, (check the age of marriage in Iran), and sex slavery was not stopped until US President John F Kennedy forced the Sauds. There is very well documented evidence to show all the above and to also show that sex slavery was rampant during the Caliphates, and there used to be markets where slaves were sold and bought.

Mind you, there was no one who took the initiative to stop this. It took a kaffir, a non muslim to forcefully stop this sick practice from outside.

All the sickos who justify this, just answer, if you are okay with the Chinese who literally treat the Uighurs the same way. Uighur Females complain of forced sexual harassments and several reports of human trafficking come up. If you are against that, it means you are okay with slavery and all only when the muslim is the one owning the slaves and not the other way round.

**7. Reading Qur'an literally gives u many scientific errors:**

The myths of 7 heavens and 7 earths, Throne of Allah, Mountains as pegs to stop earthquakes, Invisible pillars holding up the sky, Sun and moon chasing each other in the night sky, The sky being a blanket with stars being the decorations, Sun is a big lamp .... Etc , all these are just retwisted narratives from pre islamic beliefs.

All of these can be traced back to the other comparative mythologies. Modern muslims put these under the rugs by saying metaphorical and poetic. But the early islamic scholars like ibn katheer, jalalayn and others believed in a geo centric flat earth. And it was a popular belief amongst many muslims until the Islamic scholars came across the Renaissance and the Greek studies which proved irrefutably in a heliocentric round earth model after which they had to backtrack and call the earlier commentaries as wrong and rephrase the verses as ""metaphorical and poetic"".

You cannot just throw this under the rug ! Early muslims extensively believed the earth was flat.

**8. All scientific miracles or so claimed from the Qur'an are false or just already known knowledge :**

These are actually scientific errors or just basic knowledge that existed before. The embryology from the Qur'an was the biggest miracle considered which was later debunked. All the miracles from the Qur'an are just vague phrases worded together which the typical muslim cherry-picks the way they like in order to suit their agenda.  
Other people around the dawah block now do not make the scientific miracles claim as much as they did in the past, cause they know they would be busted, and rather say we should not try to find such things in the Quran as it is not a scientific book.

**9. Next we come to prophecies of Muhammad:**

Similar cases here. Stuff seems to be unfalsifiable and just vague. Stuff that later got proven like Constantinople, are like cherries that fit into the basket. What about hearing ""end times are near"" for about 1400 years! Oh let me guess! ""Here 'near' means different. We do not know when the end times will come. Allah knows best !! ""

The twisting around they have to do just to make fit a single prophecy is crazy! All the prophecies from the Pharoah, to tall building competition, to fall of Constantinople, are just bad. The Simpsons have a better record with such prophecies to be honest!

**10. The inimitability claim is a complete farce ! :**

AI creates better poetic stuff than Qur'an. The metrics are subjective as hell.  
I have tried to make sense of this argument the most. I have binge watched ""Farid Response"" and other dawah channels which talk about this claim and cutting to the chase it is subjective as hell.

However, for a child indoctrinated in a Muslim environment, the Quran's perceived supremacy is an inevitable outcome of psychological conditioning, not evidence of objective merit. Raised to view the text as divine, with its recitation reinforced through ritual and social pressure, such a child is primed to dismiss any competing work as inferior, regardless of quality. This bias, rooted in emotional attachment and dogmatic education, exposes the inimitability claim as a subjective cultural artifact, not a universal truth, as it relies on suppressing critical evaluation and exalting familiarity over merit.

Plus why would anyone try to recreate something like the Quran when any such act would have him getting death threats, as it would amount to challenging Allah, the supreme God.

As a Machine Learning Engineer myself, I can use LLMs at hand to create much much better stuff than the Quran in all clarity, complexity, and adaptability, producing poetry, prose, or philosophical treatises tailored to any style or language with remarkable fluency. But who is there to lay down all the rules and represent all the 2 billion muslims ?

The book of Mormon and the Hindu Vedas claim inimitability too. This is one of the worst arguments for Islam I have come across, but whatever had to address this one.

**11. The preservation of the Qur'an letter to letter is false**

Qur'an is not preserved letter to letter.

The Sana'a Manuscript, discovered in Yemen in 1972, is a critical piece of evidence: its lower text (a palimpsest) from the mid-7th century reveals deviations from the standard Uthmanic Qur'an, including word omissions, substitutions, and variant readings (e.g., in Surah 2:196-198).  
Secular scholars like Gerd R. Puin and Asma Hilali note these discrepancies suggest an evolving text, not a fixed one. Other early manuscripts, such as the Birmingham Folios (c. 568-645 CE), show orthographic variations due to the Arabic script’s initial lack of diacritical marks and vowels, leading to multiple possible readings (e.g., *hanif* vs. *hunafa*). The Uthmanic standardization itself, as recorded in hadiths (Sahih al-Bukhari 6.61.510), involved destroying variant codices, implying pre-existing diversity in recitation and transcription. Even later manuscripts, like the Topkapi Codex (8th century), contain minor orthographic and consonantal differences. Secular scholars, including François Déroche, argue that the Qur'an’s oral tradition allowed for flexibility in early transmission, with the rasm (consonantal skeleton) stabilized only gradually.

Compared to the Bible, the Qur'an’s textual tradition is more uniform, but this is **largely due to centralized control under Uthman and a shorter canonization period**, not divine preservation. The claim of letter-for-letter fidelity ignores the historical reality of scribal errors, regional recitations (e.g., the seven *ahruf*), and the script’s evolution, making it a dogmatic assertion rather than a fact grounded in manuscript evidence.

The best evidence for letter-to-letter preservation will be a complete, dated top to bottom autograph manuscript, corroborated by multiple identical early copies, contemporary standardization records, an unbroken transmission chain, and no variants. Than it would be a irrefutable evidence For the Qur'an being preserved letter to letter. But no such evidence exists.

Do not bring a single Manuscript parchment and claim ""hey its preserved letter to letter !!"". That is less science and more a big leap of faith at best.

**12. The supernatural stuff:**

Angels, jinns, shaitan, dajjal the one eyed monster, sun prostating towards Allah, walking stones, talking birds and ants, trees exposing where the jews are hiding etc point at some old folklore re-organized as a faith rather than the absolute truth. There are hadees about shaitan urinating in your ears, Shaitan Laughing at Yawning, Coughing, or Sneezing etc. How can anyone come to believe them in their sane mind ?

I can go on with this list, but these are enough. When u add all of these together, u can just say Islam is just another religion just like all the tens of thousands other that existed in human history. I will stop here. It's enough.

I'm pledging myself to not drinking today, and invite you to do the same.

Maybe you're new to /r/stopdrinking and have a hard time deciding what to do next. Maybe you're like me and feel you need a daily commitment or maybe you've been sober for a long time and want to inspire others.

It doesn't matter if you're still hung over from a three day bender or been sober for years, if you just woke up or have already completed a sober day. For the next 24 hours, lets not drink alcohol!

---

**This pledge is a statement of intent.** Today we don't set out *trying* not to drink, we make a conscious decision *not to drink*. It sounds simple, but all of us know it can be hard and sometimes impossible. The group can support and inspire us, yet only one person can decide if we drink today. Give that person the right mindset!

What happens if we can't keep to our pledge? We give up or try again. And since we're here in /r/stopdrinking, we're not ready to give up.

**What this is:** A simple thread where we commit to not drinking alcohol for the next 24 hours, posting to show others that they're not alone and making a pledge to ourselves. Anybody can join and participate at any time, you do not have to be a regular at /r/stopdrinking or have followed the pledges from the beginning.

**What this isn't:** A good place for a detailed introduction of yourself, directly seek advice or share lengthy stories. You'll get a more personal response in your own thread.

**WARRIORS, COME OUT AND PLAY-YYY!**

In ""Courage"" P!nk opines perfectly: ""I'm walking uphill both ways it hurts, I bury my heart here in this dirt, I hope it's a seed I hope it works. Don't have to do this perfectly."" Then she asks something we've all felt deep down inside when facing many big life changes: ""Have I the courage to change today?""

I want to talk about pride vs being prideful today. A lot of ""biblical scholars"" love to talk about queer pride like being proud is a sin. There's a *marked difference* between the two. Being proud of who you are is a *HUGE* thing. It takes some serious cojones to flip the middle finger to the establishment and say ""screw you I'm gonna be the best me ever!"" I've been the recipient of hate for both my queer status and my sobriety even! 

Being proud of my queerness and my sobriety to me *isn't* about being better than literally anyone, *that* is what the pride sin really is about. It is simply about being better than myself yesterday. Being proud of both those aspects of my life is because I was killing myself slowly with booze-fueled denial which was literally declining my health. I'm now fully present in my life, living every day as the woman I should have been living as my whole life, and so damn sober that even caffeine has an effect again! 

I'm proud as hell of the things I've accomplished, but because I put in the work to get there. Over two years of being out of the closet and 14 months sober *does not happen* without a strong will or desire for change for the better. I took a huge leap of faith getting on HRT, I took almost equally as big of a leap getting sober. I had to go on blind faith that these things would work in my favor. The multitude of ways that my life has improved would take a year of DCIs to cover. I could literally write a book on the subject from the three volumes of journaling I've done to date.

Today I'm truly happy to feel healed from the breakup of my marriage enough to just miss the small aspects of it. It's more the feeling alone in bed at night than anything. But I'm living my life being the most alive, and I'm battling on my own...something I never did before. I'm happy to have all of this time out of the closet and sober. I'm happy to be alive and finding my purpose on this planet. 

I also want to shout out u/nitram6119 for the glorious humanity check yesterday. I needed that more than words can even express, thanks friend! Thanks to all who gave support and uplift yesterday with my battles as well.

Tonight, Boston faces elimination again and I'll be watching with all my r/BostonBruins family in the GDT, who got to witness my rock bottom firsthand during a gameday thread in January 2022.

**Question of the Day:** What made you happy before getting sober that you discovered you love *more* now that you're sober. For me, it's watching hockey. NHL, PWHL, college, doesn't matter. Hockey is brutal and violent and a grind and I love watching the flow.

“Everyone, it is my absolute pleasure to introduce you to Wiggles, my pet cat. Say ‘hello’, Wiggles.”

*“Mrow.”*

About a third of the class instantly jumped in fright, wool frizzing out every which way as they collectively leaped back from the fence. The rest of us either froze in place or moved in for a closer look, though the level of trepidation was pretty equal across both camps. 

I was one of the few to get right up next to the enclosure, my mind already racing with questions in spite of the instinctual urge trying to drag me as far away from the orange predator as possible. 

*It seems so docile. Why is it so docile?*

*He called it a pet, I’ve seen that term on some of the displays. Is this what it means?*

*Did he name it like that because of how it moves? Why does it move like that?*

*Will he let us hold it like the other animals?*

*Do I even want to?*

***YES!***

Despite them being mine, the unanticipated intrusive thoughts of want came completely flying out of nowhere. A bizarre sense of envy beat itself into life as I watched the Doctor cradle the animal. Invisible paws tugged at my wool, imploring me to get as close to the creature as he was and to ignore the opposing instinct still desperately trying to pull me in the opposite direction. 

The desire grew as I gazed at Wiggles with rapt attention, amazement flooding my mind as the creature continued to purr and press itself into the Doctor’s hands.  It was a behaviour that I’d never dreamed of witnessing from a predator before; minus the humans, of course. 

With every heartbeat that passed, another sensation began to stir within my chest. One that would’ve set my tail wagging were I not making a concerted effort to maintain a front of calm interest.

**Vindication**.

Here, before my eyes, was something that supported my long hidden observations and theories. While it was pretty damn far away from being an indisputable research paper that proved predators weren’t innately evil or detrimental to the world around them, this was nevertheless a step in the right direction. The other displays in the exhibit had proven to be interesting and insightful, with the Chameleon being an unsurprising favourite of mine, but none of the animals I’d seen so far had been so recognisably expressive; certainly not any of the meat eating ones! 

A little voice in the back of my head cautioned me over reading too much into Wiggle’s behaviour, but I couldn’t help it. The purring, the flickering ears and tail, and the constant jostling around that ensured their head was always pressed firmly into the palms of the smiling human holding them; it was all so familiar. How could I not call this what it was?

Affection, plain and simple.

*Earth’s apex and their companion predators. Living together side by side without issue. I need to know how!*

Before I could leap into getting my own questions answered, a trembling voice broke out from the amassed wool of those that’d made a quick retreat.

“I-is it d-d-d-dangerous?!”

“Wiggles? Heavens no; though he can get a bit rowdy when playing, sometimes,” as if to demonstrate this fact the Doctor waved a hand above the cat in his arms, provoking a pair of small yet sharply clawed paws to shoot out and grab at him.

What would’ve sent most in the room screaming for the nearest exterminator merely elicited a gentle chuckle from the Doctor as he countered Wiggles' *attack* with a light bap to its fluffy forehead. 

As enamoured as I was with the spectacle, it clearly didn’t resonate with the huddled coats behind me. Fearful whispering instantly broke out in response to what they clearly only saw as an aggressive predatory response, unable to rationalise it as anything else despite *just* being told it was a form of play. It was predictable and, frustrating as it was, I couldn’t entirely suppress that part of my brain telling me the exact same thing. Fortunately, my desire to understand shouted it down, clamouring to make itself heard over my scared colleagues.

“Doctor, how?” A dozen ears turned to me as did the Doctor’s eyes, silently asking for clarification of what I meant. I was happy to oblige, “How is it so friendly with you? Is it because it’s a pet? I’ve seen the word on several exhibits and understand it means companion animal, but I’m not familiar with the concept. Is it only attributed to certain animals who show a calm demeanour or does it mean something more?”

“Good question Sandi, very good question. Well, to start- oh, one moment,” the Doctor paused as Wiggles began to squirm in his arms, the cat's head having suddenly turned to look my way; its pupils dilating as they locked onto me.

I felt the wool along the back of my neck prickle under its gaze but I held my ground, clenching my paw to steady the building tremor that Wiggles' piercing eyes had spurned. Carefully, the Doctor lowered the orange fluff ball to the ground, soft paws plopping to the matted floor with a barely audible thump before beginning to *wiggle* its way in my direction with the Doctor quick on its heels.

“He’s always been a curious little fellow. Where was I? Oh yes! So, what is a pet? Well you were spot on with the term companion animal Sandi. Indeed, there is enormous variety when discussing what animal a pet could be. The majority of the animals in this room could be considered a pet depending on who you asked, cats being one of the world's most popular. Humans keep animals as pets for several reasons, such as having an interest in them or simply finding them cool or cute, though the primary reason is in the word you used earlier. Companionship.”

I was sure the Doctor's explanation was honest, though I suspected he was also using the opportunity to try and appeal to the warrier students. Leaning on the social benefits of the small predator was clever. It provided the class with something familiar to grasp onto other than the anxiety seeping into their coats. While there would probably be a few who wouldn’t listen no matter what was said, either due to fear or stubbornness, the rest would ideally relax well enough to properly join in with the lesson.

“How humans came to keep animals as pets is a long story that, due to our time restrictions today, is best left for another time. If I was to give you the broad strokes, I’d say it involved living in close proximity to certain animal species for vast amounts of time; thousands of years in many circumstances, and tens of thousands for some. The animals I’ll be bringing into the pen with me today have been with us for so long that they’re nigh inseparable from us in the present day. Some work with us while others are our household friends, such as my fantastic feline here.”

While my ears were fully trained on and listening intently to the Doctor, my eyes followed the wobbly movements of Wiggles as he drew ever closer to the fence; disappearing from sight as he came right up to its edge. A pang of disappointment shot through me the moment he slipped out of view, compounded by frustration over the high plastic walls that prevented me from simply leaning over the fence to continue watching him. I glanced over at the gate Viktor had used to enter and exit the enclosure, the returning want building once more and voicing itself before I could think better of it.

“Can we come in?”

Gasps were instantaneous, as was the look of concern that slapped itself across the Doctor's face for the briefest moment before he got his expression under control. Just as he opened his mouth to answer he was cut off by a stern voice that was all too happy to nip my request in the bud.

“Absolutely not.”

Everyone’s attention swivelled onto Coordinator Molina, brow creased and arms crossed tightly over his chest as he stared at me from across the room. While his tone was certainly curt, I swore I could see the same worry that’d crossed the Doctor’s face now swimming in his eyes.

Before either I or the Doctor could challenge his decision, assuming the Doctor was on my side to begin with, someone else piped up from behind me; their opinion only serving to infuriate me.

“Agreed! What are you **thinking**, Sandi?! The small ones in the tanks are bad enough. That thing could tear you to shreds! And what about the taint? Are you really going to igno-”

“**Oh will you shut up, Vlek?!**” 

Driven to the edge by his feckless braying I spun around and stared daggers at the aggravating professor, whose ears pinned back in alarm the instant our eyes connected. Regret over snapping at him came rapidly, and the attention I was getting right now really wasn’t helping. Ears and tails fluttered and swiped with everything from mild surprise and concerned shock, all the way to aghast horror; though that last one was only felt by the person who’d stoked my ire in the first place.

*Ugh… that’s going to come back and bite me on the tail.*

Sighing internally I inhaled deeply, trying to calm myself and hoping to settle the herd before things escalated, “...Vlek, I’m sorry for my outburst. I understand your concerns.”

His ears flickered with confusion for a whisker before he tried to reply, but I was quick to pivot around to face Coordinator Molina; eager to make a case for why he should allow me to enter the enclosure.

“Coordinator Molina, I can understand if you have concerns as well, but I assure you I am happy to accept whatever risk they may pose in pursuit of what I deem to be critical scientific knowledge that could be beneficial to both my people’s understanding of your world and to the progress of the exchange.”

I tried to maintain my swiftly gathered placid composure, all too aware that my fleeting burst of anger likely didn’t reflect too well on me. He didn’t really seem too off-put by it in the same way my classmates had been, but he still had a stony look as he shook his head.

“I appreciate that you feel that way but I’m afraid my answer is still ‘No’.”

“Alejandro, come on now,” Doctor MacEwan had finally gathered his voice and, in contrast to his colleague, was upset at the instant denial of my request, “We set this all up *exactly* for this purpose. They’ve already handled most of the other animals so I see no reason to deny Sandi this, especially if she understands any of the inherent risks, of which might I add there are little to none.”

The Coordinator huffed, focussing on the Doctor and walking over to me in tandem, “Look, I get it, I’m not the expert on animals here but I *am* the one with primary responsibilities to the people here. Maybe you're right and the risks are as close to zero as they can be, but close to zero *isn’t* zero. A cat is a bit of a step up from a pair of budgies and a hamster, Bernard, and honestly, seeing as how most of you reacted to a little meowing, it’s not really the cat I’m worried about.”

He turned away from the Doctor to stare at the class. More accurately, the clump of wool that still compromised roughly a third of us. His tacit criticism rubbed a certain someone the wrong way.

“**Excuse me?!** How dare you suggest we’d be a problem while you’ve got a predator loose in there?” Vlek hurriedly dislodged himself from the huddle, straightening himself out and tamping down any scuffed up bits of wool, “Considering this nightmare you’ve thrown us into I’d say we’re handling ourselves quite well!”

*So he’s just going to gloss over his contradiction of having a predator be on the loose* ***and*** *contained? Ok, I can make this work.*

Realising the potential advantage Vlek had so *generously* laid out for me, I pushed back on Coordinator Molina with renewed vigour, “Indeed we have, Vlek! And I feel it should be recognised so that I, and anyone who may wish to join me, can head in with the Doctor and get to know Wiggles face to face.”

Vlek baulked at my continued insistence but Coordinator Molina’s eyes narrowed, perhaps catching onto my attempt to twist Vlek’s words to my own ends. Both, however, were stopped from responding as my desk mates came to my aid in timely fashion.

“**Yes!** For Star’s sake, let us in! I trust Doctor MacEwan and I want to learn more about Earth animals. How can I do that when you won’t let us get as close as possible? And look at him, what’s he going to do? My wool’s so thick that he won’t even be able to scratch me.”

“I agree that we should be able to get in there. I don’t share Rysel’s *exact* motivations, especially his negligent attitude, but learning about predators is why I came to the exchange. Plus, as an exterminator I’m best placed where I can protect everyone if something *does* go wrong. **Oh!** Though I wouldn’t hurt Wiggles, Doctor.”

I had to fight to suppress a happy whistle as Rysel and Kailo stepped up to support me, the former a buzz of excitement and the latter doing his best to radiate authority and reliability in spite of the nervousness I could see shaking through his tail. Sadly our resolute trio didn’t appear to push the needle in Coordinator Molina’s mind, his face rigid and unmoved by our appeals; I think Kailo’s *assurances* actually harmed our efforts.

Fortunately, it turned out that we three weren’t the only venlil anxious for this chance.

“I think we should let them do it.”

All eyes and ears turned to the brown shaggy wooled form of our second coordinator, Tolim. Stepping out from behind his partner, the venlil wagged his ears at us before positioning himself between us and an utterly baffled Coordinator Molina.

“Wha- Tolim no! They could get hu-”

“I know Alejandro, I know. But you heard them, that’s something they’re aware of *and* it’s a risk they accept. It’s a risk we’ve all accepted, not that I’ve *ever* felt there was one to begin with.”

*Why do I get the impression he’s not just talking about the exhibit?*

I didn’t get long to dwell on the passing thought as, after taking a moment to massage the bridge of his nose, Coordinator Molina took in a deep breath before letting it go as a long groaning sigh.

“Mmmmrrrrrr… **Fine.** But if anyone gets so much as a scratch, they’re out. Ok?”

Arching an eyebrow, he pointed a finger at the Doctor, the three of us, and Tolim, holding it on all of us long enough for us to either nod our head or bob an ear in acceptance of his terms. 

Happy, or at least placated by our promise, he turned his gaze to Tolim as a poorly hidden grin began to tug at the corner of his mouth, “I really need to stop letting you talk me into stuff so easily.”

A bleat of laughter broke from Tolim as he wrapped his tail around his partner's wrist,“Hey now, don’t go blaming me for that. They’re the ones who gave such convincing arguments. I just gave you a little push to listen to them. Come on then!”

Gesturing at us with a paw to follow while pulling Coordinator Molina along with him, Tolim led Rysel, Kailo, and myself to the gate. He waited for the Doctor’s go ahead before opening it, ensuring that Wiggle’s wasn’t about to try and bolt through any potential gaps. Thankfully the cat was far from the gate, though its eyes were still fully fixed on us; scrutinising us for reasons that were completely alien to me.

*At least for now!*

After one last painstaking whisker of anticipation, Tolim unlatched the gate to let us through, “We’ll stay on this side to let you out if you feel you need to leave. Have fun!”

Rysel’s tail twirled in gleeful appreciation as he scooted past Tolim, while Kailo in contrast grimaced but still flapped an ear in blunt thanks. I too bobbed my ears in gratitude, though my mood abruptly soured as I clocked a fourth addition to our group.

Vlek, for some night-struck reason, seemed intent on joining us in the enclosure. An enclosure that he’d ***just*** practically condemned as suicidal to be in.

He met my gobsmacked stare with a dismissive whip of the ear, pulling his posture up and folding his arms in a failing effort to disguise the tremor trembling through him, “Oh d-don’t look at me like that. I know what I-I said, but I’m hardly going to ignore the assumption that *we’re* the problem.”

Shooting a scalding glare at Coordinator Molina, Vlek impatiently waited for me to either head through the gate or step out of his way; incessantly tapping his claws off the floor and getting louder with every passing whisker. 

*Ugh, for Star’s sake! I’d hoped that after Kailo calmed down we’d have no more of this prideful speh. Damn it!*

Realising it was pointless to fight him on it and not actually having any *real* reason to stop him, aside from me simply not wanting to put up with him for a while, I merely nodded an ear at him and quickly stepped into the enclosure. For one brief moment, I hoped that Vlek’s courage would fail him at the threshold. Sadly it was not to be, and the stubborn yet still shuddering venlil joined us in the pen; wool jumping on end a little as the gate sealed shut behind him.

“Welcome everyone! I’m so pleased that you’ve joined me,” Grinning broadly Doctor MacEwan sidled up to us, standing sideways between us and the cat to keep us all in his periphery, “I know you have some misgivings about him, but Wiggles is an absolute sweetheart. That said, if you do feel uncomfortable having him wander around, I’m happy to hold him.”

Our addition to the pen spurred Wiggles into action, meandering its way over to us as hastily as its wobbly legs would allow. The motion had me utterly transfixed, the bumbling lack of coordination being completely contradictory to the measured steady pacing I’d come to expect from even the smallest of predators. Was this intentional or was there something wrong with the animal? As usual, the Doctor was there to happily provide answers to unasked questions.

“I imagine that, after getting past the fact that Wiggles is a predator, the first thing most of you will have asked is why he is moving like this? Well that’s because he has cerebellar hypoplasia, often referred to as wobbly cat syndrome. It’s a neurological condition that affects the cerebellum and primarily affects motor control. Most cats with it only require a little extra help in their day-to-day lives and are more than capable of living a full rich life.”

Shamefully, my brain's immediate impulse was to question how it was able to live into what I assumed was maturity. Everything I knew about predators told me that its parents would’ve killed it when they realised it had some form of defect. As quickly as the idea intruded into my conscious thoughts I stomped it back down, displeased with myself that I was still falling back onto an old mentality that I’d long doubted well before the humans had ever stepped onto the galactic scene. 

Kailo however clearly wasn’t as concerned with that as I was, “Doctor, I’m confused. Wouldn’t the parents cull any perceived weaknesses shortly after birth?”

While his tone and expression carried nothing more than perfectly innocent inquiry, I nonetheless winced silently at the underlying insensitivity inherent to the question. Astonishingly, rather than be thrown off, Doctor MacEwan didn’t even blink at the macabre query.

“Now that’s an interesting question Kailo, but the answer is a bit more nuanced than a simple yes or no. Do cats kill kittens? Sometimes yes, but it is very uncommon and even rarer when the cat is female. As to why? Well it can be for a range of reasons. Remember ages ago when we touched on competition in nature, that’s one of the reasons. Cats have territory and the resources within help them survive. They may perceive kittens as a future threat to those resources. Males might also kill kittens they haven’t fathered, so that their own lineage has less to compete with. And yes, rarely, mothers may kill kittens if they sense an illness, believing the sick kitten might leave them at greater risk of predation. Again this is all **very** uncommon, especially for domestic cats like Wiggles.”

*Oh. That was… unexpected.*

Despite the Doctor having taken off the proverbial pup-gloves in the last bushel of lessons, hearing him talk about such a morbid topic in a blasé academic tone was a bit off putting. Kailo seemed satisfied with the answer but Rysel’s face fell as he looked at Wiggle’s with new eyes. Even Vlek appeared to be more than a little shocked over how upfront our teacher had been. 

“With that particularly grim piece of information out of the way, let's move onto something a bit brighter, hm?”

The offer was quickly accepted by a couple dozen ears both in and out of the enclosure, flapping in agreement and eager to hear about the *bright* side that cats supposedly had.

*Gosh, I know it’s nature but that was unsettling even for me. But there must be positives to them too? Humans wouldn’t keep them around if* ***that*** *was the most standout thing about one of their most popular companion animals.*

Once again my wish for knowledge was granted by the Doctor, nearly bursting with enthusiasm as he left our side to scoop Wiggle’s back into his arms, “I know I said I’d let him wander but for this bit I’ll need his help. From the top then! Domestic cats are part of the Felidae family which comprises roughly forty-one species. Different authorities recognise different ones, but there are between forty-five and one-hundred breeds of the Domestic cat; not quite as many as rabbits. They are obligate carnivores that live around thirteen years, though they can live longer. And while Wiggles here may not be the best example, they are extremely dextrous animals, able to leap, climb, and move with precision; though you’ll find plenty of videos online showing their clumsy side too, **ha!**”

*Huh, noting that down for later viewing.*

Gingerly picking up one of Wiggle’s paws, the Doctor pressed on it lightly until claws emerged from the otherwise soft toes, “They have retractable paws that aid them in moving about but they also have a second purpose which I’m sure you can all guess. Cats are predators, and their claws and fangs are suited for small prey, such as rodents and birds. Now, while you might see this as something to be feared, this has actually been beneficial to human development. What would you say if I told you that cats were an integral part of crop farming?”

**“What?!”**

My ears pinned against my head, instinctively shielding me from the volume of an inexplicably affronted Vlek; his tail whipping in repudiating fury.

Realising that all eyes were on him, he chuffed away the flash of anger that’d overtaken him and hastily changed tact, putting on his regular scholarly air as if he hadn’t just channeled his inner Kailo, “Doctor. I know humans have a… *different* way of looking at things, but you can’t seriously expect us to believe that a non-sapient predator would be beneficial to farming in any way?”

Unperturbed by Vlek’s petulance, the Doctor merely shrugged, taking a moment to leisurely pet Wiggles before replying, “And yet they did, for a little over seven and a half thousand years according to historians. It’s pretty simple actually. Humans began cultivating grain. This attracted rodents, birds, and other small animals. They in turn drew in the cats that hunted them, inadvertently protecting the crop in the process. Admittedly It’s a rather basic explanation, but that’s the consensus on why cats started hanging around human settlements, eventually becoming the household pets we see today. It was a mutually beneficial arrangement for humans and cats and it persists even now.”

Vleks jaw slackened, mouthing out an unspoken retort as he likely tried and failed to find a way to poke holes in the Doctor's summarised history lesson. My own reflexive beliefs returned too, seeking a flaw to point out, though they fell silent pretty fast. One posited that the death of prey would prevent seeds from spreading in their droppings or fur, but that didn’t exactly apply to stationary crops. Another suggested, exasperatingly, that taint would blight the land regardless of it being protected from vermin. I stamped that one down the fastest. The last proposed that large scale cullings of small mammals could potentially lead to ecological imbalance in other places. However, considering how fast rodents reproduced, I found that to be an unlikely problem.

Ultimately the argument, though far too succinct and basic for my liking, was a fairly rational one on the surface. Even if there was more to it, it definitely clarified the start of human and cat cohabitation; though the sheer *scale* of the time frame still boggled my mind.

*Thousands of years… I’ll never get used to how they can be so casual about time like that. I can barely remember what I learned in history classes over the last couple hundred years, never mind millenia.*

“What else makes you keep them though? If farming was the only thing, I doubt you’d have one in your home, unless human houses all have allotments we don’t know about.”

Whistling jovially, Rysel pulled me from my thoughts, his ears fluttering jokingly as he took a step closer to the cradled Wiggles; pupils as big as saucers as he looked on in wonder at the orange feline.

The Doctor chuckled in kind as he turned his attention to the curious venlil, giving Wiggles a light scratch behind the ear and pulling out a happy purr, “Haha, hardly, though I do have a few potted herbs on my kitchen windowsill; nothing quite beats fresh basil. It’s like I said earlier, we crave companionship and pets can provide it for us. Cats in particular are very affectionate, are able to form strong bonds with their owners, and they enjoy playing with us; though they like to nap a lot and enjoy their solitude from time to time as well.”

Rysel slowly drew closer, his paw twitching as he watched the Doctor pet the fluffy fur along Wiggle's back, “How do they show affection? It looks like he’s just rolling around in your arms right now?”

True enough, the cat was tossing and turning within the Doctor’s arms. It didn’t look like it was trying to leave like earlier, but the head butting into the palm and the purring I’d seen earlier had stopped. Rysel apparently hadn’t come to the same conclusion I had, assuming he’d seen the previous behaviour.

“Oh in a lot of ways,” Doctor MacEwan’s face lit up and he tried to position Wiggles so that he was facing Rysel, “Rubbing their head or cheeks against you is a common one as is following you around. Purring shows contentment in your company. Greeting you at the door after you’ve been out is one too. Oh! You might find this one strange, but sitting beside you but looking away from you indicates fondness too, it shows they trust you. An animal that relies on instinct to survive wouldn’t ignore you if it didn’t trust you wouldn’t hurt it, right?”

He was right, I absolutely found that one strange. I mean I understood it from a technical perspective, it *did* make sense, but it was still odd to think about. Looking at the world through a predator's eyes and instinct wasn’t something I’d ever considered before, so suddenly being second handedly thrust into doing it didn’t come naturally.

*Hmmm… could that be why humans seem so close to so many animals? I can explain the exact reasons why a Rekan chooses one type of wood over another to build its nest, but every point I make would feel so… mechanical. Is that the human difference? They don’t just know the reasons why, but also the feelings behind it? Some food for thought.*

While I pondered this novel concept, Rysel was practically about to take off with how much his ears were flapping, amazed and apparently emboldened by the new idea, “That’s incredible! Could- Could I pet Wiggles?”

I swore I heard a wince from Coordinator Molina behind me. I definitely saw Vlek come a whisker away from having a heart attack at the notion. Doctor MacEwan held no such concerns, for his face split in a wide toothy smile the instant Rysel asked.

Before either of them could act however, our resident ‘protector of the people’ jumped between the pair, “Stop right there Rysel, you too Doctor.”

Rysel’s ears sprung up indignantly, paws clenching frustratedly as Kailo blocked him, “Seriously, Kailo? *This* is the moment to object? When we’re less than a tail away?”

Much to my surprise, Kailo didn’t snap back like always. Instead he simply flicked an ear placatingly at Rysel, “If you want to pet the predator then that’s your choice. But I wouldn’t be doing my job if I let you do it first. As a trained exterminator, I should be the one to take the initial risk.”

I could almost see Rysel’s brain ground to a halt, recognition of Kailo’s uncharacteristic thoughtfulness crashing against an urge to just ignore him. The latter impulse won.

“Risk? *What* risk? You can’t expect me to believe I’ll actually get hurt?”

“There’s *always* a chance Rysel and you need to acknowledge that. I can’t allow anything to endanger the herd.”

Rysel’s ears flopped to the side in disbelief, “Really? *You* won’t let anything dangerous happen?”

Kailo tensed, tail twisting nervously for a heartbeat before spinning up into an offended blur, “**You know what I mean!** Now let me do this!”

*Oh great. More arguing.*

Sighing I turned my focus away from my belligerent desk mates, looking to Doctor MacEwan instead to gauge how he felt. However, as my eyes turned up to the Doctor, it was Wiggles who stole my attention. Startled, annoyed, or just plain curious at the braying back-and-forth starting to kick off close by, the cat shuffled out of its makeshift cradle and stretched its head towards Kailo.

By placing himself between the Doctor and Rysel, Kailo had unwittingly gotten close enough for the shockingly stretchy feline to reach out and sniff at his ears. I really should have said something, warned him of his proximity to the cat, but I couldn’t take my eyes away as I watched with bated-breath to see what would happen.

Suddenly, a pink tongue darted out of Wiggle’s mouth and licked Kailo’s left ear, instantly causing the exterminator to bleat with fright, spin around, and launch himself back, almost crashing into Rysel in the process.

“**It just tasted him!**” Vlek bleated and, despite being nowhere near as close to the cat as the rest of us, was already mid-way through retreating to the gate as he stupidly jumped to the worst possible assumption. 

It didn’t help that the rest of the class didn’t have as good a view as I did, so all they really had to go on was Kailo’s reaction and Vlek’s accusation. Already a few of the more skittish of the class were cowering on the spot, the air of panic beginning to set into their wool much to the alarm of the coordinators and volunteers standing outside the fence.

Noticing the building dread, the Doctor swiftly sought to mollify the crowd, his deep baritone drowning out Vlek’s continued braying, “**It’s alright everyone**, it’s alright. Wiggle’s wasn’t *tasting* anyone. Cat’s are habitual groomers and it’s partly a show of affection just like the things we’ve already discussed. All it shows is that he’s interested in you. It’s definitely not a show of aggression. You’d get a lot more hissing if that was the case.”

Though nerves were still frayed, the Doctor’s assurances managed to temper the heightened fears pervading the herd. Even Vlek managed to reign himself in, but I could see he was a hair's-breadth away from letting loose whatever other condemnations were rattling around in his head.

Meanwhile the one actually *affected* by Wiggles had collected himself. A light bloom had sprung up on his face, likey out of embarrassment at having been caught unawares, “What else does it mean Doctor?”

The Doctor turned to face him, eyebrows cocked in confusion, “What’s ‘what else’, Kailo?”

“You said they lick *partly* out of a habit of grooming. Why **else** do they do it?”

Whether he trusted Doctor MacEwan or had bought into Vlek’s allegations was unclear. What *was* clear was the glare he was giving the cat, eyes narrowed and ears pinned back as he watched Wiggles for any hint of hostility. I looked to the Doctor, sure that he would confidently and neatly wrap up this misunderstanding without fuss. Interestingly, what I saw instead was him somewhat nervously fidgeting with his cane.

*Oh! Now this is an interesting development.*

Eventually, after realising he’d been quiet for far too long, Doctor MacEwan sighed reluctantly, “Ok, fair enough. So it’s nothing untoward but I didn’t think it was worth mentioning. Cats don’t just groom others out of affection. We believe they also do it to show a level of dominance over others. A mother cat keeping her youngsters in line for instance, that’s all it is really.”

There was a beat of silence as the information washed over us, broken a whisker or two later by a whistley snicker from someone in the huddle outside the fence; I assumed Lokki. It didn’t take long for the humour of the situation to hit everyone else, the suppressed chortling building into a light yet audible chorus of giggles. Glancing at Kailo I saw that, despite none of the laughter being directed at him, he was noticeably aggravated by it. 

Sympathetic of how he must be feeling I approached him, planning to help soothe his frustration. Just as I reached him however he took off, all but sprinting up to the Doctor and leaning up to reach Wiggles. Before anyone could stop him, Kailo extended his tongue and licked Wiggles right across the cat's face.

Wholly caught off guard, Doctor MacEwan could only jerk him and the cat back, his expression plastered with a combination of astonishment and bizarre amusement as he struggled to find a way to respond to Kailo’s absurd actions.

I on the other paw had no such problem, a scolding tone primed as I stormed right up to the fool, “**Kailo! What in the world was that?!**”

“**What?!** You heard the Doctor, it’s the way this predator shows dominance. I can’t let Wiggles see me as lesser than it!”

I swear, his rationale almost gave me an aneurysm right then and there, “It’s. An. **Animal**. Kailo!”

“**So?!** Predators have some of the most intricate hierarchies. I can’t be lax about this!”

“Oh, so you’d do the exact same with a Shadestalker?”

Kailo scoffed, rolling his ears exasperatedly, “Don’t be ridiculous! Even if they *did* do that you’d never get close enough to test it. Plus, their fur is like fibreglass, not soft like the cats.”

While we were busy butting heads, I noticed that both Rysel and Doctor MacEwan had fallen into hysterics; the two of them struggling to hold themselves up let alone string a sentence together.

“Hahaha! Tha- that w-w-was- haha… that was **terrific** Kailo! In- achem! In all my years teaching, I’ve *never* had someone’s first instinct be to lick an animal back in order to assert themselves. Absolutely terrific! Gold star, **ha!**”

“Heehee! I- I can’t- I can’t breathe! Star’s Kailo! **Heeheehee!!**”

Jostled by the Doctor’s raucous belly laugh Wiggles jumped out of his arms, eyes locking onto Kailo the instant its paws hit the ground and ending our argument in the same motion. For a moment the two stared each other down, a contest of wills over who would break the tension.

In the end it was Wiggles who made the first move, wobbling its way over while Kailo remained statuesque. He didn’t even so much as flinch when the cat brushed up against his leg, pushing its head and cheeks into Kailo’s shin in the affectionate way Doctor MacEwan had described.

Recognising the act for what it was, Kailo relaxed a bit; though he didn’t take his eyes off of Wiggles. Slowly he knelt down and, out of curiosity and excitement, I joined him. The cat's gaze swivelled over to me as I sat down, its yellow eyes scanning me closely. 

*By all accounts this alone should be sending me into a fitful panic, but all I feel is wonder.* 

“*Mrow*”

My heart soared as Wiggles chirped at me, shakily making its way over and plopping down in front of me. Still watching me, the cat rolled onto its back, exposing a wonderfully soft looking fluffy underbelly. A part of me screamed that this was a trap, that the moment my paw connected with its belly it would grip onto my arm, but I didn’t care. I reached out and ran a claw across the fluff, evoking another high-pitched chirp as a rumbling purr started to stir within Wiggles.

*This is amazing! It- …He’s amazing.*

Having eventually calmed themselves, Rysel and the Doctor hovered over Kailo, Wiggles and I, the both of them happy as could be as they watched on. 

Vlek stood apart from us a few tails away, dismay painted across his face, “By the Protector, you’re all mad.”

I brushed him off, too enthralled by the adorable feline to give a damn about his complaints.

As I’d suspected he might do, Wiggles ended up grabbing onto my paw with his claws but I barely even felt it. Either he wasn’t trying to hurt me or Rysel was correct and our wool was simply too thick for a cat's claws to be a risk at all. Either way it didn’t matter, for that same swell of vindication I’d experienced earlier returned with gusto.

*I was right! They’re not evil just because they’re predators, they’re just animals. And I’ll prove it to everyone, no matter what.*",Still_Performance_39,Reddit,Neutral,0.07596102726587532

2025-04-09 15:14:32,"Radicalisation/Realisation/psychedelics  combo for disaster : let’s talk about it - 
Trying to Make Sense of It All (I have been putting off posting this but here goes) 

It’s genuinely hard to understand how someone so intelligent, kind, and social—as described by family and friends could end up doing something like this. It’s one thing to stand up for a cause, but to actually go through with an alleged plan like this? To physically pull the trigger? That’s a huge, dark leap. It’s daunting just to think about.

I’ve added a few of his old tweets, some that show ideology oddly similar to Ted Kaczynski, and others referencing psychedelics, which he reportedly used. There’s also a string of tweets about consciousness, technology, and systems—maybe this was a combination of drug influence, his chronic back pain, or a slow process of radicalization. Or maybe all of it. Could the drugs have played a part in how his mind started to shift? It’s something worth considering. One tweet even discussed how drug use could help “manipulate and push the button of psychedelics via specific drugs”

He allegedly argued that some intelligent people use drugs to enhance their cognitive abilities. Was this his mindset? Maybe the pain, his intellect, and the drug use combined in a way that made him think differently about the system and his place in it.

Let’s break it down and talk about it. Please keep things amicable in the comments, it’s all alleged, and we’re just exploring ideas. If I’ve got anything wrong or if you want to add something, feel free. The more perspectives, the better




(🧐) Comparison of Ted Kaczynski and Luigi Mangione

Ok, so no denying that there’s something eerily familiar about Luigi Mangione’s case

almost like a modern echo of Ted Kaczynski, the Unabomber. I know their motives differ, but the psychology, symbolism, and methods share some similarities.

Key 🔑 basic similarities :
	•	Intellect turned inward and against society:
	•	Kaczynski was a Harvard math prodigy, later a professor.
	•	Mangione was valedictorian and a master’s-level engineer from UPenn.
	


Critique of modern systems:
	•	Kaczynski raged against industrial society and the dehumanizing effects of technology.
	•	Mangione allegedly also spoke of how tech contributes to anxiety, disconnection, and societal collapse on twitter - echoing Kaczynski. 
He also spoke about Healthcare and more (he actually spoke a lot about a lot of stuff to be fair,  academically, comedic - who can forget PHD and catfish, but I’m writing specific relative ones) 
	•	Despite different targets, both of them saw the system as a core source of our suffering.


	•	The act with symbolic intent:
	•	Kaczynski used bombs, embedding metal fragments with initials or symbols to add meaning to his devices.
	•	Mangione allegedly considered using a bomb but decided against it to avoid harming innocents. If anyone has the link or article please leave it in the com
	•	Both targeted specific, high-level figures—CEOs, scholars, or execs as symbols of systemic failure.
	•	Their acts were forms of communication, not just violence. Mangione allegedly left shell casings with messages, reminiscent of Kaczynski’s “meaning in the weapon” 

•	Lifestyle and rejection of comfort:
	•	Kaczynski lived in a remote shack, growing his own food, rejecting modern amenities.
	•	Mangione allegedly lived in similar bare-bones conditions, in hostels , possibly a storage unit, as suggested by many users. Reddit users also suggested he was vocal about embracing a minimalist lifestyle. He even wrote an alleged letter on how he was doing fine with just the basics during his detainment 


	•	Both embraced a stripped-down, almost ascetic existence, rejecting mainstream comfort as moral decay.
	•	Isolation and chosen silence:
	•	Mangione was reportedly cold and withdrawn from family and friends for months before the alleged incident.
	•	Kaczynski lived in near-total isolation.
	•	In both cases, it wasn’t just antisocial behavior—it was a conscious decision to sever social bonds.


	•	Perp walk parallels:
	•	Both were walked out publicly after their arrest
the infamous “perp walk.”
	•	both have media and all of us fixated on their intellect which makes the moment surreal: how could someone so smart do something like this?


	•	Paper trails and influence:
	•	Mangione had read about and commented and quoted a specific part on good read regarding a book by Kaczynski.

	•	This suggests maybe, just maybe, more than curiosity—it could be interpreted as influence or inspiration.
	•	He wasn’t a copycat, but the echoes are undeniable.
	•	Targeting power:
	•	Both didn’t lash out indiscriminately. Their targets were calculated
people at the top, those they viewed as gatekeepers of corrupt institutions.


(🧐) Pain, drugs l, radicalisation: combo for disaster 

Was Mangione Radicalised?

That’s one of the big, uncomfortable questions. He wasn’t tied to a political or religious movement -(made it clear on twitter he was agnostic), but the elements are there:
	•	Deep resentment toward institutions.
	•	Self-isolation and a steady build-up of anti-system beliefs.
	•	Identification with someone like Kaczynski.
	•	A final act framed not as crime, but as revelation.

Radicalization doesn’t always come in the form of recruitment. Sometimes, it’s self-made through endless online/ real life rabbit holes, obsession, and alienation (not relating with anyone/experiences/views).


The combination of intelligence, chronic pain, and drug use could have created a dangerous mental storm for Luigi Mangione. While high intellect can fuel creativity and insight, it can also lead to overthinking, isolation, and frustration especially when coupled with chronic pain (which is not fun attttt allllllll) , which can distort someone’s perception and CERTAINLY amplify feelings of helplessness 

Mangione’s alleged use of psychedelics, which he reportedly believed could enhance cognitive abilities, might have further altered his sense of reality, feeding into a growing disillusionment with societal systems. 

Drugs can distort perception, deepening paranoia and irrational thoughts, and when mixed with pain and intelligence, they can become a dangerous combination, potentially pushing someone toward radical thinking. 

This mix could have altered Luigi’s worldview, leading him to see extreme action as a justified response to his personal suffering and his perception of a flawed world. Ultimately, it’s possible that his intellectual capacity, combined with altered mental states, pain, and isolation, rationalized extreme beliefs and actions transforming what might have started as a quest for meaning into a tragic and dangerous outcome.

Conclusion:

Both men turned intellect into ideology, pain into protest, and isolation into action. What do we think ? (Allegedly for Luigi btw)

2025-06-22 11:33:07,"Changes between FFXIV and Mobile EDIT: Now that I do have the ability to edit posts here I was able to double check some things, expand a bit more on stuff and even add things I missed. Just ctrl+f UPDATED and everything that's been added or changed since the thread was posted will have that in front of it.

Documenting some of the differences between the ARR currently available in the full game versus what's currently in the mobile version, since some are pretty interesting. Plus a lot of people are probably curious so why not. There's still more content to come in the future but as of today the 22nd we have the full base ARR experience and that works as a pretty good baseline for comparison. Please know there may be small errors here and there, I'm not a native chinese speaker, most of this information has been worked out through my own gameplay, experience, playing with menus and features, and additionally asking questions and reading what other players are doing in the FF14 Mobile US Discord.

**Story/Quests**

* All players start in Ul'dah regardless of chosen class. Limsa/Gridania starting out quests are not available whatsoever.
* Story is effectively the same, some quests streamlined a bit and level pacing is different.
* Occasional jigsaw puzzles during some quests where you need to get an item from an NPC to give to others (eg the early quest from Papashan where you hand out pretzels).
* Occasionally the quests will place a chocobo for you as the objective that will fly you to the next location, interacting with them requires giving them a gysahl green in a timing-based minigame.
* Similarly, occasionally quest NPCs act as direct teleports to other locations, moving you to the required location after speaking to them.
* On some occasions when visiting a new safe location, the quest objective will actually get you to interact with the Aetheryte before continuing on to the NPC/whatever else you need to do.
* Chocobo's are now unlocked fairly early at Lv7 during a quest where you visit the Immortal Flames to pick up a Chocobo Permit. In line with this change, there is no provided Chocobo Barding available for free until later on when you join a Grand Company and get their barding as you would normally.
* The Aether Compass is unlocked around Lv9 when you first visit the area outside Copperbell Mines by the miner who sends you up to get some shards, due to the change to unlocking flight in ARR regions.
* Quests with Solo Instances now have minimum Item Level requirements and will not let you enter if you don't meet it.
* Combat Levequests have been removed, in line with future expansion content.
* MSQ currently stops at the end of Patch 2.0 after The Ultimate Weapon.

**World/Regions**

* There are no physical changes to the world, all maps are the same as the original.
* A QoL change in Major Cities is the ability to click and teleport directly to an Aethernet Shard from anywhere. You can use them as your teleport destination when needing to travel back to the city to visit a certain guild or whatever, or within the same city they can be clicked and teleport with no cast time.
* *UPDATED*: As of 23/06/25, the Auto-Pathfinding feature has been removed from the cash shop and made an early story reward, plus mailed out to all current players who have already finished that quest. [This is likely a response to it being a major focus of negative reviews](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIV_Mobile/comments/1lfx56x/chinese_versions_reviews/). Auto-Pathfinder automatically moves you to quest objectives, including teleporting and using mounts. However, it does not use flight, walks in kind of awkward grid straight lines, [and isn't perfect](https://streamable.com/h807l7).
* *UPDATED*: Teleporting is free. Home Points have been removed; when dying in a zone, you return to the closest Aetheryte in that area.
* Unlocking flight has been reworked to use the Aether Current system from every other expansion, varying from 4 to 8 currents to find. None are locked behind a quest reward, and every region can be completed on first visit with the exception of Western La Noscea due to restricting travel to the Isles of Umbra until a certain MSQ quest; in line with this, two currents are in that area and can't be reached early.
* All FATEs have been brought over. FATEs can spawn with higher difficulty and rewards called High Risk and are marked in pink on the map instead of blue. Bicolour Gemstones and Forlorn Maidens have been added, along with new limited time buffs that can appear after killing/collecting objectives that power you up for about 15 seconds. Along with more EXP and gemstones, High Risk FATEs also have the chance to drop coffers containing a random piece of glamour equipment.
* Additionally, there is a series of extra objectives to be completed in every FATE, such as getting so many monster kills, defeating the boss, collecting items, and other varied tasks that can be completed over the course of repeating the FATE several times. These unlock extra rewards in the FATEs menu.
* FATE rewards are sent out even if you are in a situation where you can't normally receive it, you will be allotted the EXP and items immediately when the FATE ends and a Moogle mails you the details of your rewards if you are unable to be present for the FATE ending notification. This includes leaving the zone, being in menus, and even entering instanced content.
* New types of world events have been added. Buried Chests can be found around the regions, with friendly marmots to guide you to them. Performing bands can be encountered and using emotes in their vicinity grant you a buff to EXP Gain and Bicolor Gemstones earned in the area. There is a Goblin Merchant that can be found around the world, and helping him pick up his stuff and returning it will progress a bond level that adds new items to his store.
* Details from future content have been included on maps where appropriate, for example the maps for Ishgard and Coerthas Western Highlands can be seen on the full zoomed out Coerthas Region map.
* Content wise the game seems to be a weird mix of Patch 2.0 with current day QoL and features. Revenant's Toll is the completed version. Beast Tribe camp locations are all present in the maps. Gold Saucer is available.
* Notable features that are actually the opposite, should be present but actually missing, includes The Wolves' Den. The PvP content is currently completely absent and the Ferry NPC can't be interacted with, yet the location is present on the map and even detailed with its Aetheryte, Delivery Moogle, pins, names, etc. Hall of the Novice instances and rewards are also not present in the game. Guildleves aren't present. Lastly, Housing is currently missing. Palace of the Dead is also absent, but despite technically being ARR content it was introduced in HW so that might be why.

**Combat Classes/Jobs**

* Class Quests have been condensed down to Levels 1 through 10 and serve as early content and tutorials along with a source of gear and experience. Completing the Lv10 quest unlocks the associated (Class) Ring as a glamour and makes the Job Stone available. Guild Teleport Tickets have been added to let you get back to your Class Quest NPC immediately upon completing objectives.
* Once you get your Job Stone you can not take it off. The Class is effectively gone.
* Job Quests remain paced like the original and become available at Lv35 and every fifth level, giving you gear and experience, artifact gear at Lv45/50 and the better recolored version in a coffer as well at Lv50 like normal.
* Job Actions have been obviously streamlined and changed while keeping the identity and general playstyle in mind. There are new skills and animations here and there, but otherwise they are built out of familiar elements.
* All Jobs have access to a standard action button (the big one with the iconic relic weapon design) that serve as a basic combo. For melee classes it's your basic 1-2-3, with the bonus that at a certain distance it also turns into your ranged attack (eg Warrior's turns into Tomahawk) whereas for mages they serve as a reliable instant cast button to use while moving around.
* Another new button is the evasive action button, the one underneath the standard action. This serves as a self-explanatory movement skill that gets you across a short distance quickly and activates Sprint for four seconds. This is available every fifteen seconds. Animations vary, such as dashes or rolls. White Mage gets to float around, kinda cool.
* At the Arcanist's Guild, you can pick up the Scholar unlock quest at the reception desk as well and unlock it independently. Alongside this change, Summoner and Scholar no longer share a level.
* With Mages, spells are locked in at the end of the cast bar. With this change, casting at an enemy who then dies during the cast time will activate the spell on the next available target instead of interrupting the cast. For healing spells, casting single target heals with no target selected will automatically target the member of your party with the lowest HP.

**Crafter Classes**

* *UPDATED:* Crafters now have a Job Gauges. These vary by class, some are shared across two, and they replace the Condition mechanic from the original game. u/ifuchen has provided a lot more indepth details about all the different Job Gauges in a [comment you can read here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIV_Mobile/comments/1lhlr8q/comment/mzaoouk/?context=3).
* Material style items like lumber for Carpenter are only made using Quick Synthesis style crafting, waiting for completion with an optional gil cost to skip to the end.
* Normal crafts can be made in bulk, having enough materials allows you to craft multiple of an item at once with the same Progress/Quality craft. Completing the item and having certain stat requirements enables an automatic craft for that item.
* An option is available in the crafting log above an item to bring up the gil vendor purchases for all the required materials on one screen and you can pick how many of each you want and pay the total cost out.

**Gatherer Classes**

* Pretty much the same but with less buttons.
* *UPDATED:* Fishers show the details of the current fishing spot at the top of the screen, clicking on an entry shows details like recommended bait and the !/!! hook notice to look for. There is also a timer element present on the screen that shows you how many seconds it's been since casting the line.

**Dungeons**

* For the most part, this part of the experience is still the same. I will note some interesting notable changes below. MSQ Dungeons appear to be mostly their Rework designs, whereas optional ones are not, so that lends some weight to the game being based on a late ShB/early EW build.
* Poetics are available immediately and can be earned on non-50 jobs., so funds for Lv50 gear can be worked on all the way through your progression. There are two other tomestone tiers at Lv50, Verity that is used to buy Materia and upgrade items, and Genesis that is not yet available (maybe when Coil is out on July 3rd.)
* *UPDATED:* Unrestricted Mode (Undersized) is available for most dungeons in the game already. Duty Support is available for dungeons required for the MSQ. Additionally, there is a new selectable mode called Challenge Mode available for dungeons and trials that disables AOE indicators, mechanic timeline (in high end content), Echo, the use of any potion items, and locks the instance to Minimum iLv. This can only be directly queued for with a pre-made party.
* *UPDATED:* Stone, Sky, Sea for ARR is available after completing MSQ from an NPC in the Quicksand. It is instanced instead of being placed physically in the world (uses the Wolves Den arena) and can be accessed directly from the Duty Finder.
* Just as an overall change, optional chests are gone. Also I'll note that I don't 100% remember every single boss mechanic from content this old, I might have missed some in-fight details but for the most part I'm pretty sure I've got everything.
* *UPDATED:* When you wipe to a boss, you are placed right back in front of the boss gate. There is no return option available until the whole team wipes.
* Sastasha (Lv10) - No notable changes.
* Tam-Tara (Lv10) - The very last part at the end where you would walk past the barricade to a room at the end and unlock it is removed, the barricade just opens when you kill the mobs there. The room is still present, just empty.
* Copperbell (Lv10) - Explosive powder pickups are removed.
* Halatali (Lv15) - Pre-Rework version. No pulling the chains in the second section.
* Toto-Rak (Lv20) - No notable changes.
* Haukke (Lv25) - Optional rooms are sealed, no keys. The only room in the basement with anything in it is the last room, and killing the mob there unlocks the boss door as if the key was used. The other part of the top floor is barricaded.
* Brayflox (Lv30) - No loot chest after first boss. No reward chests from the Gobbies when rescued.
* Qarn (Lv35) - Pre-Rework. Optional rooms later in the dungeon are still there, but the rewards have been removed and the scales before the final boss just opens both doors with no puzzle.. The Doom mechanic and floor pads from the first boss have been added to the final boss.
* Cutter's (Lv??) - not in the game lmao
* Stone Vigil (Lv40) - No notable changes.
* Darkhold - (Lv??) - also just not in the game
* Aurum (Lv45) - No notable changes.
* Castrum M. (Lv50) - No notable changes. Cutscenes can be skipped if no-one in the party is a first-timer.
* Praetorium (Lv50) - No notable changes. Cutscenes can be skipped if no-one in the party is a first-timer.
* Labyrinth of the Ancients (Lv50) \[[video](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIV_Mobile/comments/1lhhv8t/labyrinth_of_the_ancients_8man_raid_blm_pov/)\] - Including this here since there's no better section to list it in, and there's definitely some changes. Labyrinth of the Ancients is now a Full Party content type, eight players, and changes have been made to bosses to accommodate this while keeping most of the experience intact. Loot is treated like a normal dungeon and there's no restrictions on rolling for multiple pieces.
* Amdapor Keep and Wanderer's Palace appear to be missing too.

**Trials**

* Story Trials are now Full Party content and significantly more involved fights. The primal trio drop weapon coffers with level appropriate gear, plus some other rarer drops like Titan having a minion, or special glamour chests that reward a random piece of glamour gear.
* Ifrit (Lv15) \[[video](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIV_Mobile/comments/1lf7jin/ifrit_normal_8man_blm_pov/)\] - Similar to a Hard Mode, features four nails and a new mechanic will falling aoe markers and meteor markers that drop aoes behind a moving player.
* Titan (Lv35) \[[video](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIV_Mobile/comments/1lg6qtv/titan_normal_blm_pov/)\] - SIGNIFICANTLY different fight starting out similar, only having one stage of arena breakage, heart phase swapped with an add phase, then the second half of Titan featuring EX mechanics like triple landslides and Ultimate Ultima's version of Upheaval.
* Garuda (Lv45) \[[video](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIV_Mobile/comments/1lgol6e/garuda_normal_blm_pov/)\] - Like Ifrit, a mix of later difficulties. Summons the sisters for an add phase where Garuda herself becomes untargetable.
* Ultima (Lv50) - Porta Decumana is classified as a Dungeon rather than a Trial and is played with a Light Party, and is the same version of the fight currently available in the original game.
* Titan HM (Lv50) \[[video](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIV_Mobile/comments/1lhksb4/the_navel_extreme/)\] - Closer to the Extreme version with harder versions of mechanics in phase one, two adds instead of one in the ""heart"" phase, the jail mechanic added, and so on. This fight (and presumably future high-end content) features a new HUD element showing upcoming mechanics and when they're going to resolve.

**Gold Saucer**

* For the most part it's the same content. Same games, GATEs, etc. Notable changes include;
* Downstairs mini-games have new gameplay, generally based on timing touch screen taps. The crane game is mostly the same but bigger with more balls to land on and a bit stricter detection on if you touched it.
* Fashion Report has been fully reworked; instead of clues for individual slots, players are shown five NPCs and can view the final score Redolent Rose has given them. Using the theme and these NPCs as a guide, you can make five attempts each week using rental gear to put together the glamour from just Head/Body/Legs/Shoes. Matching the theme adds up to 12 points per slot with another 3 points if you actually own the glamour yourself, making 88 the max score for borrowing gear and up to perfect 100 if you own the outfit you made.
* Jumbo Cactpot pays out different reward tiers based on matching numbers in different slots, it does not only pay out from right to left. For example, with the first week's winning number 4526, I got 58,500 MGP from a ticket with 4552, 5,000 MGP from a ticket with 2020, and 2000 MGP from a ticket with 2255, nothing matching.
* Winning in GATEs on the Main Stage can unlock up to three extra Jumbo Cactpot ticket purchases in a week.
* Leap of Faith appears to be the only major GATE not currently available.
* Chocobo Racing/Breeding, Lord of Verminion and Doman Mahjong are currently unavailable.

**QoL/Etc**

* All ten servers act as one data center and share the party finder. Parties and Linkshells are cross-world by default, with only Free Companies being restricted to your server. Notably new to these cross-world features is that the Market Board is shared, showing the seller name and server on each item.
* *UPDATED*: Parties have a built-in opt-in voice chat feature integrated directly into the game. Once you're in a party you'll see the mic and audio toggles (off by default) where you can choose to speak or just listen in.
* As well known, Glamour is significantly different where you use Prisms on an item to unlock the glamour version and can freely change what's equipped in glamour slots whenever you want. A lot of old Lv1 items you wouldn't ever use as real gear only comes in glamour versions, as are store outfits, so they just get added directly to your dresser. Dyes are used to unlock colors on individual pieces which can then be freely used afterwards (eg unlocking Dalamud Red on your Evenstar Coat makes it freely available even if you change the colour to something else later). Popular meme aside, not all gear has 16 different dye channels. Most have one or even none. The more layered gear is likely the cash shop items, I can't preview dye on unbought gear so I can't confirm this. 15 Glamour Plates are available, outfits made can be saved to them and then linked to a Job. You can buy more plates with the real money currency.
* Certain max level gear has upwards arrow icons that indicate the ability to be upgraded into +1 versions, raising their stats and item level. Currently the Poetics gear has this function, requiring Titan Hearts to upgrade that can drop from Titan HM or bought with Verity tomestones.
* Materia are melded onto specific gear slots within a Job, not the piece of gear itself. Any materia melded to your head piece will be swapped over to any other gear in that slot when equipped. The first two slots are guaranteed melds, with the others being 25%, 15% and 10% chances for the remaining three.
* Stores (Gil Vendors, GC Seals, MGP, achievement, gemstones, etc etc literally all of them) can be accessed from any location from the menu.
* *UPDATED*: Market Board can be accessed from any location from the menu, with both purchasing and selling available through the menu. There are 12 sale slots available by default and this limit can be doubled if you have purchased the monthly pass.
* Levequests dont need to be accepted, just turned in for the result, and can be accessed from any location from the menu.  After unlocking Levequests, you get 10 turn-ins every day at morning reset and up to 100 can be stored unused.
* GC turn-ins can be, you guessed it, accessed from any location from the menu.
* Some collections/completion lists are incentivized with reward milestones. Every so many achievement points, glamour items unlocked, FATE objectives, etc, have additional rewards available from their associated menu.
* Inventory is a shared overall limit, with no Armoury Chest split. That means you can have as many or little as any gear type without worrying about fitting it all in the armoury chest or emptty slots being ""wasted"" storage, but of course the tradeoff is managing it all within the one overall limit. inventory limit can be expanded with items earned from quests, events or the battle pass, or for a gil cost. It starts at 300 items and goes up by 20 each upgrade tier, with the required upgrade item amount going up each time (1, 2, 3, etc). If you use gil for an upgrade step it still increases the required item count for the next step, and vice versa increases the gil cost.
* *UPDATED*: Retainers aren't available, along with any of their functionality like extra storage or ventures. Storage has been rolled into the expandable limit mentioned above. Chocobo Saddlebags are also not in the game.
* There are a lot of refreshed or new visuals for certain menus. The materia menu has a kind of dynamic visual where the item is in the middle of a big wheel and the materia rotate around it with focus on the slot you have selected. Triple Triad has moved the board to fill most of the right side of the screen and the left shows the player and opponent clearly, who also now emote based on how the match is going. Lots of other examples.
* Daily Quests with extra rewards are doing two leveling roulettes, one trial roulette and one high level roulette (potentially a raid roulette reward will be added too later)
* Weekly Quests are more diverse, featuring FATE gold medals, Gold Saucer GATEs, mini-games, Triple Triad, Total Crafts, Total Gathers, GC Turn-ins, Levequests, and Treasure Maps alongside doing 12 Roulettes over the week. These have their own reward track that give out random reward chests, MGP and Gil for getting through them.
* As a free-to-play version of FFXIV there is obviously different monetisation aspects different from the original game's Mog Station and Additional Services. [Details on what this content is like has been previously detailed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIV_Mobile/comments/1lf8c1f/monetisation_content_available_as_of_launch_day/), with [details about the Battle Pass here](https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXIV_Mobile/comments/1lf8c1f/comment/mym6ivi/).",RablaAndrews,Reddit,Positive,0.11287412222184043

*That was the Atreknas' biggest mistake. Thinking eliminating the Mad Lemurs was the key to victory.*

*The Elder races who had fought them and survived to become their friends and allies knew the secret. The Younger races who had heard the words* ""Do you need assistance?"" *and accepted could feel it all around them.*

*The Mad Lemurs changed you as a people. Their attitude and behavior was more infectious than any illness. In their presence even the most beaten down and hopeless would find themselves standing straight, casting  defiance in the teeth of overwhelming odds.*

*It went beyond forging the weapons and ships. The Mad Lemurs forged whole races.*

*They took the raw materials and forged them into the best version of themselves they could hope to be. It was a lesson well learned by the ones who had been through the process.*

*And a lesson they were more than willing to pass on.* \- Scholar [Bergusia](https://www.reddit.com/user/Bergusia/), Rigellian University of Applied Knowledge, ""Lessons of the Second Precursor War""

He had fought the lemurs before.

He hadn't liked it then.

He found he was enjoying it now.

True, he was injured. His opposing thumb on his left hand was gone, a bullet had snapped it off but the thin bone hadn't provided enough mass to cause the shell to crack and the antimatter to be exposed. Rather, the bullet had detonated on a tree behind him. He had shrapnel peppered across his back but the tiny wounds had sealed closed from coagulated blood.

There was only two of the lemurs left.

He could see them, from where he was crouched up in the tree, watching them.

He had learned, through the night and early into the day, that using phasic powers directly against the lemurs exposed him somehow, triggered some kind of reactive defensive system in the lemur's primitive brains that struck back with a primal scream of rage and indignation at being touched by another's phasic ability.

He had learned not to fight as he had been taught, as he had learned in the Old Universe. He had to follow the rules of the New Universe, the glorious, violent, malevolent universe that hated its own creation with enough hatred that it caused suns to burn.

He had realized that basic truth as he had made noises of distress and put mud on his arm to quench the two small snowflakes of spooky particle white phosphorus that had eaten their way into his flesh. His arm was swollen, hot to the touch, caked with mud and wrapped with leaves that he had secured with thin vines.

This universe hated and hated fiercely. Not just the Atrekna, but everyone and everything.

This universe, the New Universe, was a malevolent universe.

He had learned his lessons through the night.

Not to come directly at them, but to stay hidden, strike from ambush and quickly withdraw. Even a wounding blow counted.

To be patient.

Stalking other Atrekna through the millennia was an exercise in watching plots slowly unfold, to carefully manipulate things to get the desired outcome.

Here, in this wondrous malevolent universe, patience involved simply waiting, being alert but ready to react or take action to provoke a reaction.

It was...

...it was...

...exhilarating.

They were crossing a river. One was injured in the leg, limping along, a bandage of OD cloth wound such a way as to hide the pale interior soaking pad. The other had lost her rifle and held a pistol in one hand as they hustled across the fallen log.

They were heading for their own lines, attempting to break contact.

He could let them go, let them flee. Break contact and return to his fellow Atrekna, see how the war was going against the lemurs, see who was closest to taking possession of the planet. Return to the Conclaves and Quorums and Consensus as well as the Communal Mind. To put his efforts toward taking the planet.

That was the logical course of action.

But he found, strangely, that he didn't want to.

The one with the injured leg suddenly stopped on the log. The lemur in the lead said something but the other shook her head, handing her rifle to the one in the lead.

As he watched, as the other lemur hurried across the log, the wounded one turned to face him. She raised her face to the sky as she pulled off her battered armor and tossed it away, letting it fall into the river. She removed her shirt and her undergarment then drew a large knife. She sang as she dragged the tip of the blade across the top of her breasts, cutting her flesh, letting the blood flow down her mammaries.

Before, he would not have understood the lemur's actions.

But that was then and this was now.

He jumped from tree to tree, using his phasic powers smoothly, easily, the clumsiness of yesterday gone after long practice in the dark.

The leap from the tree to the ground at the near end of the fallen log was a long arc. He landed, one knee down, one curled fist into the ground, using his psychic powers to bleed off the kinetic energy and inertia from the jump.

He slowly raised up, keeping his prismactic camouflage field up, and faced her.

She set her feet and hefted the blade in one hand, her other hand open and down by her waist. Her face was determined, her nose swollen with cut across the bridge that had closed with gummy coagulated blood.

The lemur chattered.

He answered.

""Free... can-dy,"" he whispered out the sounds, unsure of what they were, just knowing that he had heard the lemurs say it.

He let the camouflage field drop enough for her to see the end of his phasonium and warsteel staff. See the sharp point and the bladed end that had only been decorative before. Just something to impress the other Atrekna with.

She wiggled the knife. Her eyes went from cold blue to amber.

He let the field drop.

She gasped, seeing him in all of his naked glory. He had used his empowered and phasically enhanced robe to set a trap just before dawn and now he wore nothing on his purple flesh. He stared at her with all three red eyes.

""Free... can-dy?"" he trilled.

Her eyes went burning red.

""Does it... hurt?"" he trilled.

She snarled and rushed forward.

He gave an undulating screech and rushed at her, thrusting with the staff.

For the next fifteen seconds it took everything he had to keep her from gutting him right there. Her knife flashed in the waning daylight, her teeth were bared in a snarl, and she kept slamming her fist into his flesh.

Before the night the blows themselves would have hurt him, crippled him, left him keening in agony and fleeing.

Now, his flesh was hardened by his phasic abilities. It hurt, but the pain was far away as he focused on keeping her from killing him.

He saw an opening, just a slight one, with his third eye.

He thrust the staff forward.

It punched through her stomach, the iron hard muscles of her abdomen resisting for a moment. He felt the blade grate on her spine he drove it clear through her.

She spit blood in his face, grabbing the staff with her free hand, and pulled herself forward.

He twisted the staff.

She sliced him down the side of his head, narrowly missing his eye.

He lifted her up off the ground, her boots kicking.

She drove the knife into his shoulder, just an inch of the blade.

He whooped out a war cry and lifted her higher.

She slammed her open palm against the pommel of the knife and it suddenly punched through his phasically hardened skin and muscle to sink deep into his skin.

With a roar of effort he turned and threw her away from him, her body flying off the staff.

Her arms and legs flailed as she fell into the ravine.

He turned away.

Even if she survived the fall, she was out of the fight.

He had won.

He walked, slowly, across the log, feeling the mist of the waterfall coat his skin, cooling him down more than his purplish thick sweat had been able to. He reached the far side and took a moment to clean the edge of the blade with one thumb and a finger, squeegeeing it clean.

He have a roar of triumph, throwing his head back and vocalizing his victory.

He wrapped himself back up in the cloaking field and jumped for the trees, crouching down.

His injuries pained him. It was tearing agony to remove the blade from the soft tissues of his shoulder, but he managed it. He heated the tip of his staff with phasic energy and seared shut the wound. He then slowly closed the wound on the side of his head with the heated edge of the blade, roaring with pain when he was done.

He closed all three eyes for a moment, reaching out and grabbing a branch to steady himself.

He felt...

...felt

...alive.

Gone were the endless years and decades of patient waiting for a plot that, at the most, would eliminate a rival or shift his standing slightly. No longer did he perform experiment after experiment and get the same results, trying to find some way to change what had already happened and what would be no matter what he did.

The New Universe was malevolent but bountiful.

The other lemur had given him the slip, moving into the brush. He moved around slowly, using his eyes, the same eyes that had allowed his people to see any foes before they had come to rely so much on phasic powers, to disdain physical effort. He listened closely with his ears, the same ears that had warned his people of ambushes and helped locate prey before his people had set aside that gift from the Old Universe to use only phasic power.

His tentacles wiggled in an equivalent of a sneer.

How short sighted. How pathetic.

The Old Universe had given his people the tools to rise to primacy and his people had thrown them away to pursue phasic power only. To put meager logic patterns against the chaos of a hateful universe.

This wasn't the Old Universe.

This was the New Universe.

And here, it was eat or be eaten.

The manipulations, the plots, the plans, the carefully orchestrated complex interweave of alliance and betrayal of the Old Universe was useless here.

There was only those who banded together to increase their killing power.

And those who died.

He knew that now.

He turned from the thick forest.

She wouldn't leave. She wouldn't run.

Any more than he would.

It was down to the two of them.

The laws of the New Universe, the Malevolent One and All, would forbid them from fleeing from one another.

While one still lived, the other was in danger.

*There can be only one*, he whispered to himself as he glided across the tree, heading back into the forest where the night and day had been spent in a brutal stalking hunt.

\-----

He had a split second warning, almost too little to do anything. He got his phasic shield around and stepped to the side just in time. Still, the swinging log hit his shield and sent him stumbling back, the phasic disk shattering in an explosion of sparks.

She came at him fast, sticks in her hands whose ends had been carved into sharp points and hardened with fire.

She was shirtless, mud and chlorophyll covering her skin in daubed patterns. Her blue eyes were a cold amber as she swung twice then dove into the brush as he swiped the staff around and almost got her, just slicing away part of the heel of her boot.

He jumped up into the trees and looked around.

Nothing but forest. Where the female lemur had gone he did not know.

He held still, his feeding tentacles tightly curled, as he surveyed the ground.

*There!*

She was moving fast, dodging around trees, a long sharp stick in her hand.

He jumped from tree to tree, following her.

She ducked underneath a log but didn't come out the other side.

He jumped down to the ground, looking around.

The tree had fallen and split when it had hit the ground, creating an arch.

He moved forward, squatting down to look into the arch.

The female lemur jumped off the top of the arch where she had been crouched behind a handful of ferns.

And drove the spear into his back.

He roared, stepped back, and used his phasic power to rip the spear free.

It had narrowly missed his lung.

The female lemur grabbed another spear.

He let the camouflage field drop and she took a half step forward and stopped.

Hanging from a vine around his torso were four skulls, their helmets buckled onto the bone, the strap keeping the lower jawbone in place. The vine went in one eye and out the other. He had carved phasic runes of power onto the jawbones.

She braced herself and spat gibberish in her language.

He repeated it back to her slowly and carefully.

""Come. Get some... then..."" he said.

She snarled and he brought up the level of phasic energy through his skin and muscle as far as he could.

He moved forward, stabbing with the staff, slicing along her hip. She stabbed him in the leg with the spear. Then they were past each other, both turning around to face their opponent. Another clash, and another, and another.

She had a cut on her forehead. A long gash along the side of one mammary. A cut on her hip.

He had a stab wound to his arm. One to his hip. A broken finger.

He dropped the staff, pulled the lemur knife from where he had stored it between the teeth of a skull, and spread his arms out in a dominance pose.

She screeched and shook her broken spear over her head.

They charged at one another.

The spear had a crackling feeling as it penetrated his chest, pushed through his body, and exited his back.

The knife ground on the ribs of the lemur as he stabbed deep.

They both collapsed on the ground.

For a long time nothing moved.

The female lemur stood up slowly, reaching out and steadying herself on the log. She stood there for a long moment, just breathing heavily.

Finally, she turned and limped away, vanishing into the ferns.

Time passed.

Fingers curled.

There was pain. So much pain. A roaring river of pain. An avalanche of pain.

The Atrekna opened his eyes, staring up at the sky.

Every instinct, every experience, told him to lay on the ground and wait to die.

He gave a low growl, repeating what one of the lemurs had screeched at him as it had gotten to its feet.

""Didn't... hear... no... bell...""

He got up slowly. He slowly pulled the spear from his body. It was sharp enough to penetrate his skin, penetrate phasically enhanced muscle.

But dull enough to push everything out of the way instead of tearing it apart.

He looked around. The lemur was gone.

She had been victorious as the stars of the Malevolent Universe had watched.

The prize was hers.

He understood that now.

But he too had earned prizes. Prizes the bountiful but hateful universe bestowed on those who tasted and drank deep of its wisdom.

He picked up the knife and heated it before pressing it to his wounds, sealing them shut with a flare of agony and the stench of scorched flesh and blood. He sat and rested for a long moment before he got back up, using his phasic power to sustain him.

He tied the knife to the spear that had been driven through his body with strips of cloth he tore from the discarded top of the lemur's uniform.

He jumped up into the trees, wrapping himself in the phasic camouflage field, the spear in one hand.

\-----

The Conclave had been forced to retreat by the Mad Lemurs of Terra. The Dwellerspawn were all dead, ripped apart by the fury of the lemur's martial might.

They had a bare dozen members left as they carefully reached through time and space to locate what they were after.

A jumpship.

Concentrating, they brought it forward.

It was damaged. The armor dented and dinged. Many of the precious crystals were cracked. It was scuffed and battered.

But intact enough to be spaceworthy and capable of making FTL jumps.

The effort of moving it through had killed half the Atrekna, leaving a pair of each caste staring at one another. Two Young, two Old, two Ancient.

The ship wasn't large. There would be no privacy, no seclusion. Each would be at the mercy of the others.

All of them eyed one another as they slowly moved to the ship. The door opened with a squeal, revealing cool red light inside.

They tensed as they gathered near the door.

\*\*In what order should we determine possession of the ship\*\* an Ancient One asked.

There was a thump on top of the ship.

As one they looked up.

Standing on top of the ship was an Atrekna, but not like any Atrekna they had ever seen.

It was taller, broader, its limbs thick with muscle. Its purple skin was covered in scars and brands.

Its eyes were burning red.

It wore a crude vine around its torso, from which lemur and Atrekna skulls hung, the lemur skulls all buckled into helmets.

In one hand it held a staff of phasonium and warsteel that all the Atrekna present could feel the power of.

In the other it held a spear made of crude wood with a knife tied to the end. All of the Atrekna could feel the cold malevolence rolling off of the spear.

It stared down at them with cold burning red eyes.

\*\*I believe you have my property\*\* the strange nude Atrekna whispered into the communal mind, its thoughts a sibilant whisper that invaded the communal mind and twisted around the other's thoughts.

""Free... can-dy..."" it whispered aloud.

One of the Ancient Ones let loose with a blast of psychic power, almost contemptuously, confident that its power would seriously injure if not destroy the obviously defective one.

The blast rippled the air but had no other effect.

The Atrekna standing on the top of the hull of the craft threw its head back and gave an undulating cry that made the others draw back.

Before they could do much more than exclaim over the communal mind in shock, the strange one dropped down into them.

It was over in moments.

The sole Atrekna closed the door behind him as he moved to the cockpit.

As he left the planet, the stealth engaged, he thought about it.

He had fought the lemurs before.

He hadn't liked it then.

He liked it now.

This is my second cycle, I tried to apply through Kaplan last year and I feel like it worsened my chances rather than improve them. So this year, I’m trying to be more careful.

I was also wondering if universities are working in tandem with such agencies to increase admit numbers to a particular programs, isn’t that red-cash-cow flag? And when I see great colleges like Duke and John Hopkins do this shit I’m even more appalled and even more cash-cow-alerted! But this is just a thought !

I wanted to find out Fabio’s history and his odd face, so I did a bit of a deep dive into Chinese mythology and came across the story of the carp that transformed into a dragon… and suddenly Godwyn’s malformed carcass made sense.

Godwyn upon death was becoming a dragon. The correct way to transform, not through dragon communion but by being accepted due to his perseverance. 

From Google: According to legend, a carp that successfully swims upstream and leaps over the Dragon Gate undergoes a transformation into a dragon. Historically, this metaphor symbolized the elevation in status attained by a Chinese scholar after overcoming the rigorous levels of the Chinese civil exams.

2024-11-07 14:35:03,"A Historical Overview of Pluto in Aquarius and What to Expect from This Transit I've seen many people associate Pluto in Aquarius with progress. While it's true that progress can result from it, that’s not always the case. What typically comes from it is transformation and shifts in social organisations. I've reviewed 11 Pluto in Aquarius transits, and the pattern that has consistently emerged in all of them is the decline or transformation of major powers. The fall of empires, civilisations, hegemonies, political systems, dynasties, and kingdoms is a trend seen in all of these transits. A second trend, occurring 10 out of 11 times, is cultural and religious transformations, along with ideological shifts. The third most common trend is the rise, expansion, and consolidation of new powers. Pluto’s influence is often more about radical shifts and restructuring than straightforward progress. Progress might come as an indirect result, but Pluto's main role is to disrupt, dismantle, and transform, often forcefully.

Overall, Pluto in Aquarius means a period of intense social chaos, political instability, fragmentation, etc. Why? Because all of those are necessary to achieve social changes and power shifts. 

So it's clear to me what to expect for the next 20 years: The decline and transformation of major powers. And how can it manifest?

🌸 Possible decrease or loss of hegemony for the US (or at least a transformation of it). Even Rome, one of the most powerful empires, underwent transformations during the different Pluto in Aquarius transits: it gained influence, transitioned from a republic to an empire, was divided, regained some territories but not full control over them, lost territories again, and eventually weakened (by the next Pluto transit, it had already disappeared). So if we extrapolate it to the present, we can see that US power may undergo a similar transformation. Who knows, maybe even the dollar will be challenged. Pluto in Aquarius is not directly related to money, but since US power depends largely on the dollar, it’s not far-fetched to think the dollar could be challenged as well, especially with the rise of alternative economic systems, digital currencies, and shifts in global trade dynamics. However, the US’s transformation or loss of hegemony could also happen in other ways, and only time will tell how it unfolds.

🌸 Destabilisation and possible fragmentation of the European Union. In the present day, the West holds most of the power and influence, so we can expect a change and transformation in that as well. Throughout history, European countries have largely been at odds and at war with each other, so the EU’s cooperation is an anomaly in history, and it’s already weakening. There are already increasing tensions and divisions within the EU, particularly around issues of sovereignty, economic policy, immigration, and political alignment. And anti-EU parties are gaining influence in both Germany and France. So, in all honesty, with an upcoming transit like Pluto in Aquarius, I really doubt the EU has what it takes to remain intact after that. If it doesn’t dissolve, it will likely undergo some kind of major transformation, possibly involving changes to its members, but we’ll have to wait and see.

🌸 There could also be a reformation in the UN, as many people are also calling for a reform of the UN Security Council to remove the veto power of the five permanent members. This aligns with Pluto in Aquarius themes, particularly with its emphasis on decentralization, equality, and questioning established hierarchies. 

🌸 Another common trend we've seen is the rise and consolidation of new powers, so this makes me think about the BRICS gaining power, which seeks to challenge Western-dominated institutions like the IMF or World Bank and establish alternative structures that allow for a redistribution of influence. The growing interest in expanding the BRICS, along with moves to create financial independence from the US dollar, could accelerate under Pluto in Aquarius, fostering a multipolar world order where power is shared or distributed in ways we haven’t seen before. Or maybe not even the BRICS, but China. China has been consistently rising in recent years, and it has a very special relationship with Aquarius and Pluto in Aquarius. So, could it be that China will finally consolidate as the dominant world power? Only time will tell. And because Pluto in Aquarius is erratic, it’s also possible that new powers (that aren't the BRICS, China, or Europe/US) could emerge unexpectedly.

🌸 There will be some kind of cultural, ideological or even religious shift, as this is also a common trend of this transit. Of what kind? I have no idea. But maybe this could lead to new philosophies or belief systems around consciousness, existence, and human purpose, perhaps even a movement questioning what it means to be ""human"" when technology plays such a central role in shaping experiences and identity. AI rights, maybe?

🌸 Possibility of intellectual and cultural advancements, as well as scientific progress. However, contrary to the popular belief about Pluto in Aquarius, this transit doesn't primarily focus on science; it mostly centers on social aspects. While it's true that in the last two Pluto in Aquarius transits, technological and scientific advancements have increased compared to earlier Pluto in Aquarius transits, the focus has still been more on social change and these advancements seemed more like byproducts of the societal shifts taking place. So if the trend of the last two transits in scientific matters continues, then yes, we could also see further scientific and technological advancements. And with the rise of AI in recent years, I wouldn't be surprised if that technology continues to develop exponentially. This transit is likely to affect the way AI integrates into our daily lives and reshapes societal structures, which might mean AI is used more to address or facilitate social reorganisation and collective issues, rather than purely for technological sake. But as I mentioned, scientific and technological transformations typically take a backseat to social transformations during this transit, so innovations may arise as responses to changing social needs, upheavals, or shifts in power, rather than being the primary aim of the period. And I think the emphasis would still be on how these advancements alter social relationships, power structures, and collective identities. Who knows, maybe it could be the time when human/AI personal relationships start to develop. In this context, Pluto in Aquarius could drive society to rethink relationships on a fundamental level. It could also be related to virtual realities and the metaverse as a new form of societal organisation where people build communities, establish social hierarchies, and even create alternative economies. Imagine a society where people form meaningful friendships, partnerships, and even “live” parts of their lives in the metaverse, with AI entities or avatars as central members of these communities. 

So these are my takes and things I think will happen during the upcoming Pluto in Aquarius transit based on the way it has manifested throughout history. One thing I've also noticed about this transit is that whatever happens during this time has lasting consequences and impacts in the next generations, usually until the next Pluto in Aquarius transit brings some new waves of change. 

I also want to mention that I tried to be as objective as possible when analysing the data. This meant getting rid of my preconceptions about Aquarius being progressive, scientific, democratic, liberal and so on. I'm a huge science nerd, and I consider myself quite liberal. Had I analysed the data with a biased outlook, I would have focused on the last 2 Pluto in Aquarius transits only (the French Revolution and Protestantism) because they fit the progressive/liberal narrative, or I would have included scientific advancements and breakthroughs in the 3 main themes of the transit. But that’s not the case at all. And as contrary to my expectations as the facts are, I have to present them as they are.

**EDIT December 2024:** Since Aquarius is also said to be related to social media, it isn't a surprise that events like the Tiktok ban in the US, the social media ban for under 16 year olds in Australia and Russia managing to block global internet for 24h are happening right now. I think we'll definitely see a transformation in our relationship with the internet during this period. Maybe these networks won't be as interconnected anymore.

What do you think? Do you have any takes or predictions?

* Formation of Chemical Nomenclature (1787): Lavoisier and other chemists created a systematic chemical nomenclature, standardising the naming of chemical compounds and elements, which remains influential today.
* Invention of Smallpox Vaccination Techniques: Edward Jenner began experiments that led to the development of the smallpox vaccine in the late 1790s (although his breakthrough publication would be in 1798). Jenner’s vaccination method became one of the earliest examples of immunisation. (1777 - 1798 CE)
* Herschel’s Discovery of Uranus (1781): William Herschel discovered the planet Uranus, expanding the known boundaries of the solar system. His use of powerful telescopes marked a leap in observational astronomy.
* Cataloging of Stars and Nebulae: Herschel and other astronomers systematically cataloged stars, clusters, and nebulae. These observations helped to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the Milky Way. (1777 - 1798 CE)
* 1783: First successful hot air balloon flight.
* Coulomb’s Law of Electrostatics (1785): Charles-Augustin de Coulomb formulated Coulomb's law, which describes the force between two electric charges. His work was foundational for understanding electrostatics and contributed to the future development of electromagnetism.
* Exploration of Electric and Magnetic Phenomena: Scientists like Luigi Galvani (1791) discovered bioelectricity, observing that electrical stimulation could cause muscle contractions in animal tissues. This finding laid the groundwork for electrophysiology and future studies in neuroscience.
* Improvements in Optics: The development of better lenses and telescopes allowed scientists to study the properties of light more accurately. William Herschel and others made important discoveries about light and color, with Herschel discovering infrared radiation in experiments just after this period. (1777 - 1798 CE)
* Optical Instruments: Technological advancements in optics led to the improvement of microscopes and telescopes, which played essential roles in discoveries across biology and astronomy. (1777 - 1798 CE)

* American Revolution: The United States wins independence from Britain, founding a new democratic republic. (1777 - 1798 CE)
* French Revolution: The fall of the monarchy and the rise of radical political movements in France, including the Reign of Terror. (1777 - 1798 CE)
* 1780-1781: Tupac Amaru's revolt against the Spanish colonial rule in Peru. Although it was unsuccessful in overthrowing Spanish rule, the impact of this revolt was such that the Spanish hardened their control over the natives to the point of erasing their culture altogether. However, the ideas and memory of Túpac Amaru II lived on. His revolt became a symbol of indigenous resistance and anti-colonial struggle. It inspired future movements in Latin America, especially during the wars of independence in the 19th century. 
* 1791: Haitian Revolution Begins – Enslaved Africans in Saint-Domingue (Haiti) revolted against French colonial rule, marking the start of the only successful slave-led revolution in history.

**Preface**
-
There has been a lot of talk lately about the state of healers in PvE, and frankly a lot of knee-jerk reactions. When preliminary SB details were revealed, the sky was apparently falling for White Mage. WHM was declared ""dead"" by some people, and the #ripwhm memes were rampant.

More recently, there was a popular post titled [Scholar is NOT okay](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6it562/scholar_is_not_okay_before_downvoting_me_and/), as well as a [a rebuttal](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6it562/scholar_is_not_okay_before_downvoting_me_and/dj9dybq/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=ffxiv) to said post. While both posts had good points, I personally don't fully agree with either of them (but much more leaning towards the rebuttal). I kinda feel like the OP was set out to prove that SCH was in an awful place and the rebuttal was out to prove that the OP was completely wrong. I'd rather see something more impartial and objective.

*Impartial* and *objective*. That's what we're aiming for here. No whining about your favorite class being garbage, but also no ""kumbaya"" shit where we act as if all classes are well-designed and equally balanced. No biases or predispositions. Just facts and intelligent analysis please. Hopefully we can get a good discussion going.

**Astrologian**
-
It's no secret that Astrologian is likely the most desireable healing job right now in PvE. It feels like it has unique strengths and no real weakness.

Pre-Stormblood, AST was already in a good place. They were the king of raid utility, thanks to cards (namely Balance) providing the party with unmatched damage utility as well as other niche applications that helped with defense and recovery. If AST had a weakness, it would be its lack of ""free"" healing. Essential Dignity and Collective Unconscious are very good, but still less than what WHM and especially SCH had to offer in this area.

In Stormblood, AST got **Earthly Star**, which shores up this weakness to a huge extent. A free AoE heal that's nearly equivalent to two Indoms plus 200p AoE damage on a 60s cooldown is extremely powerful. From my experiences, it has already proven to be godlike in both Susano EX and Lakshmi EX. To a smaller extent, Lady of Crowns is a another source of free healing that's worth mentioning. I still feel that AST is still behind the other two healers in this area, but it's much closer.

As for cards, **Lesser Arcanum** and **Sleeve Draw** further boosted AST's raid utility. Lesser Arcanum grants more value to your card draws. Sleeve Draw, as random as it may be, grants better Balance uptime and allows more non-Balance utility that doesn't come at a compromise to Balance.

Basically, AST's weakness was shored up by Earthly Star. AST's strenghts were further boosted by Lesser Arcanum and Sleeve Draw. I'm not gonna say that AST is the best at everything, but the sum of AST's kit in its entirety just simply makes it the most desireable healing job. 

To me, it is but a foregone conclusion that the preferred healer meta is AST plus a sidekick (WHM or SCH). Some of us have even toyed with the idea of double AST, but I'm personally skeptical about that.

**White Mage**
-
Pre-Stormblood, WHM was already the red-headed stepchild of the healing trio, as the healing meta was all about SCH/AST. The sheer damage advantage of SCH/AST was insane, and WHM didn't really provide anything that came close to making up for the damage loss. Moreover, the content itself wasn't very WHM friendly. WHM's strengths lie in their throughput healing, but Creator Savage encounters don't really play to WHM's strengths, mostly due to how little healing was actually required.

So, when preliminary details were released about Stormblood abilities, everyone was up in arms about White Mage's Secret of the Lily mechanic, which to be honest is quite bad, even after if it's been buffed from its initial build. It felt like WHM was already the weakest and got the least, so they must be in a bad place. I initially kinda felt that way too. Then came the ""RIP WHM"" memes.

However, after thinking about it for a bit, I thought that WHM was actually buffed quite considerably. Oddly, the majority of the buffs were upgrades to already existing abilities, and as a result these buffs flew under the radar.

WHM's **MP economy** was one of its biggest weaknesses pre-Stormblood. Now, with Lucid Dreaming (upgrade over Shroud), the CD reduction to Assize, and the addition of Thin Air, it's become one of WHM's strong points.

The CD reduction on Benediction, and the additions of **Divine Bension** and **Plenary Indulgence** meant WHM got more free healing. Plenary Indulgence is pretty underwhelming due to its low proc rate, but when it procs, it's a nice little bonus. I'm very impressed by Divine Benison though. I do find myself casting at least one Cure II every 30s or so, meaning I can still make good use of Benison despite not casting very many Cures.

The change to the old Cleric Stance meant that **Assize can now simultaneously damage and heal**. Players who seeked to optimize damage tended to use Assize only as a damage oGCD. The change to healer damage means that WHM gained even more free healing. Again, important to note the CD reduction from 90s to 60s.

**Cure III is an unique asset to WHM**. If the conditions were right for Cure III to be used, it gave you so much control over the group's stability. In Creator Savage, there weren't a lot of good situations for Cure3. However, I feel that its recovery potential in Susano EX and Lakshmi EX is pretty good. This may be the case for Omega as well.

The one thing WHM is missing from its kit is **damage utility**, which is something both AST (Cards) and SCH (Chain Strategem) have access too. However, I think WHM's strengths are a decent tradeoff. White Mage has the best healing GCDs by a wide margin. Regen is the most potent and efficient single-target healing GCD. Medica2 and Cure3 are the best AoE healing GCDs. Cure2 is the best spammable heal, it unlocks Divine Benison (by guaranteeing a Lily), and can proc a Confession stack for Plenary Indulgence.

Despite initial concerns that the Secret of the Lily mechanic sucks (it still does) and the downgrade to Divine Seal, I think WHM is overall very strong. Great GCD heals, great oGCD heals, great MP economy. For what it's worth, they boast superior AoE damage, especially when combined with Presence of Mind and Thin Air. They're only missing damage utility.

**Scholar**
-
If claiming that the sky is falling for WHM was the flavor of last month, claiming that the sky is falling for SCH is the flavor of this month. 

I can understand why, but much like the knee-jerk reactions to WHM, I feel like SCH problems are greatly exaggerated. Especially in [the aforementioned post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6it562/scholar_is_not_okay_before_downvoting_me_and/) that got really popular. I honestly feel that the post was so heavily upvoted and gilded because SCHs were upset and wanted to rally behind a post that justified their own negative feelings about the class. Not because the content of the post was particularly rational. Much of what I have to say about SCH will be responses (agree/disagree) with what was said in that post.

Pre-Stormblood, SCH was the healer god. Superior damage efficiency, superior healing efficiency, superior mitigation, superior MP economy. What more can you ask for? 

So, what happened?

While Scholar got a several small nerfs here and there, they all certainly add up. On top of that, I feel that the sweeping changes to all healers in Stormblood negatively impacted Scholar the most. The culling of damage abilities is going to hurt the class that had the most efficient DoT damage. The change to Cleric Stance hurts the class that was the best at being in Cleric Stance. The loss of mitigation skills (Virus, Disable) hurts the class that had the strongest mitigation skill (Supervirus).

All these things collectively contributed to SCH's tumble from the top of the healer meta. However, is that enough to say that Scholar is weak or ""NOT okay""? 

Let's take a closer look at the aforementioned post, titled [""Scholar is NOT okay""](https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/6it562/scholar_is_not_okay_before_downvoting_me_and/). While many of these points are valid, I agree with /u/ColourOfCalico that many of his points are sensationalist, exaggerated, unproven, and outright wrong. It's just a BabyRage that got popular because it justified other people's BabyRage. The fact that the post got so popular reinforces the subreddit's reputation for sheep mentality, to be quite honest.

I agree that **the nerf to Bane was unwarranted and heavy-handed**. However, on two targets, your Bane still gets full value. On three targets, 100/100/80 instead of 100/100/90. On four targets, 100/100/80/60 instead of 100/100/90/80 So, in these situations, Bane is actually not too bad. A total nerf a 4%-8% in these situations. Bane only becomes terrible when dealing with massive AoE packs and 4-man dungeons. However, I don't think this is the biggest deal. In a team setting, I can't imagine a situation where a healer's AoE damage makes or breaks an encounter when every DPS class has a plethora of AoE damage options that they are just itching to unleash. In the grand scheme of things, this won't matter as much in end-game raiding, barring some insane AoE DPS check where healer AoE makes or breaks it. I just can't see that happening.

When it comes to **single-target damage**, this post claims that SCH's DPS was already inferior to WHM. He misses the point of damage efficiency. Sheer DPS output is irrelevant when you're required to heal at the same time. How much damage you can do to a dummy is NOT important. How much damage you can do while outputting the necessary amount of healing IS important. SCH did get a nerf in this area, but they were already leaps and bounds strongest in this area in Creator.

Talking about **Scholar's MP economy**, Scholar's Aetherflow got nerfed and MP costs were increased. However, they now have access to Lucid Dreaming, a type of ability that they never had before. Overall, their MP economy got worse. But is that something SCH should be complaining about? Scholars in Creator ran the absolute bare minimum Piety in many fights. The fact that Scholars could outright ignore this stat indicated that Scholar's MP economy was overpowered. How can any of us complain that Scholar got nerfed in this area?

""**Chain Strategem** is just a poor man's balance"" is a piss poor argument. We all agree that Balance is overpowered to hell and should be nerfed. But, that doesn't mean that Chain Strategem is not a very powerful ability and a huge reason to bring SCH. The existence of Balance doesn't undermine the usefulness of Chain Strategem, especially considering when they can be used in conjunction with each other. This part of his post really hammered home to me how biased and sensationalist the OP actually was. Comparing a strong ability to an even stronger ability just to make it look weak, in order to support your narrative that the sky is falling for Scholar. Pls.

The absolute most bullshit part of his post was ""REGEN > FAIRY"". I guarantee you that if you offered every WHM and AST to replace Regen and A.Benefic with Summon Eos, they would take it in a heartbeat lol. ""The only cost is a trivial GCD"" is a poor argument. Free Embraces over and above existing Regens without investing a GCD is extremely powerful and I can't believe someone can downplay this aspect of Scholar. 

So overall, did Scholar get worse? Yes. But **listing a bunch of ways that they got nerfed is not enough to say that SCH is unviable and ""NOT okay""**. It's simply a kneejerk reaction. All it means is that SCH is no longer the undisputed healing god. Yes, I understand that SCH loyalists are going to be upset about that. I even agree that the nerfs to SCH were a bit overboard. But, also bear in mind that before the nerfs, SCH was at an insanely high starting point. 

People need to look at the bigger picture: Does this still have a place in the meta? Is there enough reason to choose SCH over WHM? Indomitability and Whispering Dawn is still insanely powerful, as is Deployed Adlo. Chain Strategem is stil DPS optimal in a game where high DPS solves so many problems.

I'm still sympathetic to SCHs. The class does feel worse and less fun to play, which is a valid argument. There are still many fixes I'd like to see implemented or nerfs reverted. If SCH is less fun to you, it's an subjective opinion but one with a lot of merit. 

Nonetheless, SCH is still very strong in the healer meta. High healer DPS, very efficient healing, and now damage utility. 

I think everyone needs to chill out about it. SCH may not be as strong as it once was, but it's still got a place in a raid setting and might still be considered optimal above WHM. You can be upset that SCH got nerfed, you can be upset that SCH isn't fun to you anymore. That's justified and understandable. But don't say it sucks as a job, because it doesn't.

**The Bigger Picture**
-
I think any argument comparing healer-to-healer is kind of moot. 

I've seen people crunch numbers about how Adloquium is less MP efficient than Benefic II, Cure II, and Nocturnal Aspected Benefic. This is a pointless comparison, when SCH's MP pool and recovery works differently from the other two healers. So, why are we measuring them on the same scale? Makes no sense. As I mentioned before, the argument about Chain Strategem being a poor man's Balance was utterly ridiculous. In the same vein, why are we comparing Regen to Fairy Embrace?

Instead, what people should be comparing are healing duos: AST/WHM vs AST/SCH vs WHM/SCH (maybe AST/AST too)

Personally, I think AST/WHM and AST/SCH are both very strong, while WHM/SCH is quite a bit further behind.

AST is really strong because of having a pretty complete kit plus the overpowered Balance card, but greatly benefits from a co-healer who can output a lot of ""free healing"". WHM pulled a lot closer to SCH in this area but both are great ""sidekicks"" to AST.

**AST/SCH** has superior damage, due to Balance plus Chain Strategem. 

**AST/WHM** has superior healing GCDs and stability/control.

I think these two comps are more-or-less equal or very close to it, depending on what's important to you and your static and also depending on encounter design. I actually have a slight preference for AST/WHM vs Susano and AST/SCH vs Lakshmi, but that's all based on anecdotal experiences. In any case, you can make solid arguments for either comp being ""optimal"" over the other. But notice how all three healer jobs are involved. This is an **improvement** over what we saw in Creator, where AST/SCH was strictly better than the other two healing duos.

That's why I think it's silly hearing people acting like the sky is falling for WHM or for SCH, when all three healer jobs fit in the meta. Before anyone says ""easy for you to say because you're an AST main"", I'm not the type of person who just wants his favorite class to be OP as fuck. I'd like to see class balance just as much as anybody else.

*And others that are older.*

*Much older*

“H-hey Hastur. You ready to do something unwise?”

*Hastur clutched his book close to his chest, anxiously scanning the old stone chamber...*

""You know it's funny... most of the time my answer to that is yes. It still is but... the sentiment is definitely different...""

*He sighs.*

""Did you bring the ember...?""

“N-no..not exactly….”

“I was hoping to keep that ember, a-and your clever box.”

*He gestures at the walls, stained a dark maroon, circles and sigils and runes crisscrossing the beams*

“B-but this…I think this should work, without detonatjng a star beneath the bowls of Ithacar”

*Old Ithacar runes. From a pagan and darker time*

“D-do you know what you are looking at Hastur?”

""Summoning... no... opening... is this... a gateway?""

*His brow furrows, brushing a hand across a weathered stone surface, feeling the relief of the runes carved into the surface.*

""This place is old, I can feel what must have been done here but... Will it still work?""

“I-in the days before portal magik was perfected, t-to travel to distant lands, practitioners needed these gateways. Its p-probably this exact sort of thing that might have even been used to reach Carcosa in the old days.”

*Theres a shifting, a strange breeze, carrying the distant sound of singing*

“But its defunct. S-so it might need a little kick.”

*He holds up a gauntleted hand. Its glowing bright green*

*Hastur sighs, and the anxiety in his face is replaced by a cold stoicism.*

""You'll need to tune it properly...""

*Hastur said, lowering his book as the pages flutter open.*

""It's called Lost Carcosa for a reason. It's not supposed to be easy to find.""

*Strange inky tendrils spill from between the pages. They slither across the ground, creeping into the stonework and filling the gaps between with shimmering blackness.*

*Kardonk’s suit hums as   the air around him shimmers. Courtesy of the tech Talluluh Bombshell had taught him, he was wrinkling space in their immediate vicinity. Pulling power from the wards to push and probe for anything that might resemble a gateway or even a battery.*

“Let me sing you a tale of a land that once was”

“A land now hidden from the seas”

“And skies above”

“Is it secrets you seek? Or the terror that youll meet?”

*He nods at Hastur to finish the line*

“Who knows in Dark Carcosa”

*The words came grimly from his lips, but also with a note of sorrow...*

""Along the shore the cloud waves break,
The twin suns sink behind the lake,
The shadows lengthen
In Carcosa...""

*A different poem this time. From another book. One that was both known by many and remembered by few.*

“Strange is the night where black stars rise,

And strange moons circle through the skies

But stranger still is
Lost Carcosa”

*The two scholars stand chanting even as the wind whips a smell of a pine and forest forlornly into the circle*

""Songs that the Hyades shall sing,
Where flap the tatters of the King,
Must die unheard in
Dim Carcosa.""

*Hastur's eyes darkened, the runes shifting as shadows writhed between the stones. The smell of rain on stone... the sound of mournful singing and the lapping of waves against an unseen shore...*

“Song of my soul, my voice is dead;

Die thou, unsung, as tears unshed”

*Kardonk’s voice catches. This was a place of lost memories. Could he…was it possible his mind could be restored there?*

*Or would the land just consume him as well?*

“Shall dry and die in
Lost Carcosa.”

*Silence followed. Long, deafening silence. Before the stone circle began to shift. It rippled like water, the surface becoming glassy as a pale light slowly filled the room.*

*Two suns traced slowly across an alien sky, cloud-wreathed towers silhouetted against their dying light. A lake stretched from the horizon and back... and all the while, a mournful song echoed.*

*Hastur trembled as he stood at the precipice of the vision as the stone began to writhe. The suns darkened, the singing faltered...*

""No... it's not enough... I can see it, but the door isn't fully opened. If we try to pass through now...""

""It needs more... it needs a connection...!""

“Y-your right”

*He gestures to the black iron box that holds the ember*

“O-open it, quickly”

*Hastur nods, reaching into his sleeve and withdrawing three small glass vials. Two hold a clear liquid, and the other a dark red.*

*He opens them, and a droplet spills from each into the three locks of the black iron chest. The wards hum, the mechanism clicks, and it opens. The unmistakable presence of the Ember burns within...*

""N-now what...?""

*He looks scared to even touch it.*

""You were right when you said not to detonate it... even this far beneath the surface, I fear the damage it could do to Ithacar above... do you have another plan?""

*The portal continues to waver...*

*Kardonk takes the ember*

“Its a land o-of lost memories right?”

*He had warded the perimeter to guide the flow of the flame. Prevent an uncontrolled conflagration.*

“Bring a memory to mind. S-something you are willing to lose.”

*Hopefully it would be enough*

“It n-needs a sacrifice.”

*So many memories gone, burned. That which was left was precious*

*Kardonk watched as **The Sight** revealed a twisting mote of flame  between the two of them. The invisible fire flared as Hastur offered his memories, and then recoiled as the wards pulled the excess energy from the fire, keeping it from growing into an inferno*

*And with a sigh, he offers up the first time he ever handled his revolver. The first time he ever fired it, and heard the bullet strike true.*

*Hastur watched the look on his friend's face as the memories burned between them, feeding the flame as it fed the gateway between worlds. The portal filled with pale light and the sound of lapping waves...*

""I think... it worked...""

*Before them lay Carcosa. The waves breaking upon the shores of Hali. It was like staring into a painted world... all amber hues and brush stroked skies.*

*Hastur looked... heart broken.*

""Kardonk... I haven't been... as honest as I should have been...""

*Kardonk blinks in surprise, breaking his gaze with the mesmerizing vista*

“H-hastur…you swore…”

""I-I never lied to you...! I just didn't know how to tell you... the fragments. They're not just drawn to me... they-""

*Hastur's words were cut short.*

*Something burst through the gateway. An arm, long and gnarled with flesh like ink and smoke. It grasped Hastur by the arm with long fingers and he cried out.*

*Another wretched hand clambered through the open door, and another, and another until the brilliance of the twin suns was blackened by withered limbs, clawing at Hastur and muffling his screams as they drew him towards the gate.*

*Shite*

“Damn you Hastur!!!!”

*He yells, flinging a white phosphorous flare the midst of the tendrils. Trying to burn away the shadows and reveal more of this new foe.*

“You know something. S-speak, dammit! Your life depends on it.”

*He could try burning it with memory fire, but he knew nothing about this foe. How far could such a conflagration spread?*

*Again he pulls power from the wards and the air around him ripples. Tendrils of wire and steel erupt from his armor, grabbing Hastur and engaging in this eldritch tug of war.*

“Y-you will not have him! I dont care if he’s a dishonest Librarian!”

*Five of these tendrils, burning hellish hot lash at the dark shadows*

*Prometheum wire whips out of the tendrils in intricate patterns. Attempting to use the n-dimensional properties to disrupt the portal’s structure*

“No!”

*Kardonk leaps for the closing portal, to short he just misses Hastur’s outstretched hand*

*He flings a tiny mote of memory flame at Hastur’s mind. Nearly imperceptible. It should do little more than make him a little more absent minded than usual*

“And to you dark city, black city, who says you even deserve a king?”

*Most importantly it should be nearly undetectable. Kardonk reckoned there were probably four beings in all reality who might be able to notice the hidden mote. And of those, likely only two could do something about it*

*But he could track it. It didnt matter where, it didnt matter how. Anywhere the Lightless Flame burned his detectors should be able to find it*

*It was only a matter of time*

*Hastur's hands flashed with spell fire as he fought to free himself from their grip.*

*A chorus of voices echoed against the stones.*

**A throneless king**

**A nameless thing**

**A shadow lost and wandering.**

*Hastur grasped the wires with his own bare hand, desperately trying to pull himself to freedom. It burned across the mass of shadowy limbs, searing lines of light that hissed.

""The fragments are the memories! They are a part of-"" *A hand clasped across his face* ""-a part of the city! The King is the City! The City must have a King! The fragments will-""

**Broken on the sundering blade, beneath black stars that die and fade**

**Foreign flesh, familiar mind, grasp we now to find and bind.**

""KARDONK...!""

*With a final shriek the hands withdraw in upon themselves, Hastur's hand slipping across the prometheum as he is dragged into the collapsing gateway. It snaps closed with a shockwave that trembles the stones.*

*Silence returns. And Hastur is gone.*",The_Hij,Reddit,Neutral,0.07027879412254415

2023-10-17 05:27:14,"I need to vent about the Constellation storyline Disclaimer: This is a rant.  Emotions in mirror may be smaller than they appear.

I've been doing the main questline, having completed pretty much all the other faction questlines, and I swear to god it's so bad, it feels like it was written by a completely different team compared to the other stories.  The other stories in the game, while I have some complaints, are overall very good.  So how did the main quest turn out such a mess?

To illustrate, I'm going to dissect how asinine the last part of this quest I've done has been, which is where you have to go with Matteo (the worst character in the game, you won't change my mind) to meet Keeper Aquilus.  And he then has you go around and put together the details of that whole story about ""The Pilgrim.""  This whole thing is completely stupid and I need to get this off my chest.  Here goes:

1. The completely ridiculous leaps of logic.  It's not so much that he spews nonsense, it's that the game acts like I should remotely take this lunatic seriously when every word out of his mouth sounds like something out of a Flat Earther.  That last bit with ""Infinitum Addendum"" turning into ""Indum"" is straight up just that word association conspiracy theory meme from a couple years ago.
2. So we're determining the coordinates for a specific stellar body by the story told by a random Va'ruun zealot in the city lockup?  A story this person is telling me *orally*, from memory, and then assuming the *numbers* in that story are accurate?  I played this quest less than an hour ago and I already forget the damn numbers!  Not to mention how numbers tend to inflate when told through oral tradition!  There's a reason Chinese oral tradition has crazy things like the Jade Emperor wandering the Earth for 326 *million* years before ascending to godhood.  For pity's sake, this is your main quest line, you could at least get me to hunt for a contemporary source!
3. Speaking of those stupid coordinates, those were from *how* many years ago?  It was from the founding of House Va'ruun, so like 130 years at least.  For all the research they seem to have done into astronomy for this game, the person writing this part seems to have missed the extremely obvious fact that, you know, *stars move.*  At least have me go back to see Noel and have her help me math out where this star actually would be now relative to like 130 years ago so I don't wind up in deep space!
4. Are you seriously telling me that I'm supposed to take this preacher's word that he even knows what the hell he's talking about, just because he happened to talk about ""Unity"" in his sermons?  And yes, I'm aware it's a charade and he already knows where it is, but my character doesn't know that.  And if he's trying to convince me he figured it out then and there, you'd think he'd put on a better show, because right now he looks less sane than Alex Jones.

And this is just my latest frustration with the main questline.  Don't get me started on Matteo, who's a vapid caricature of a religious person with less theological acumen than a college sophomore.  Every time he opens his stupid mouth I want to slap him and tell him to shut up while the adults are talking.  Or how badly they bungle introducing Constellation and the whole mystery of the Artifacts.  Or how you're part of a supposedly scientific organization, but you never seem to do any actual *science*.

Actually, you know what?  I *am* getting started on that last one.  You telling me a organization devoted to scientific exploration finds something like the temples, and they don't even *try* to mount an expedition to take samples, scan everything, and conduct experiments with the power rings?  Or run you through a battery of tests to check how your powers work and what their limitations are?  That last one would even be a great powers tutorial.  I remember walking into Constellation for the first time, and just hearing *nobody* having a single actionable experimental plan to try to prove or disprove their hypotheses.  For that matter, I don't think most of them even *had* a hypothesis, they were just like ""oh that's weird, let's find more!""  Are you scientists or not?!  Then meanwhile Matteo is sitting over there being like ""oh, but what if it's *God*?  Or aliens that are God??""  Which any *actual* religious scholar could tell you is stupid, because that's not what religion is and it's certainly not what religion is for.  And all of that just adds to how, pardon the pun, *vacuous* the Constellation storyline is.  It tries to tackle these big ideas about science and religion, but it completely falls flat on its face because the science people aren't doing any science, and the religious guy doesn't seem to even understand what religion is!

2024-02-28 21:19:21,"Game of Thrones Producer Options Pasulka's UFO Books: A Skeptical Perspective I've been delving deep into the work of Diana Pasulka, particularly her books ""American Cosmic"" and ""Encounters,"" and I can't help but raise my eyebrows at the mounting hype. She's positioned herself at the intersection of religion, technology, and the paranormal, presenting herself as a scholar unearthing truths about UFOs and non-human intelligences. But the more I look into her claims, the more I'm convinced we're witnessing a masterclass in grift rather than groundbreaking scholarship.

Pasulka, a professor of religious studies, has made quite the name for herself, consulting for movies and docu-series and even being featured in the JJ Abrams docuseries ""UFO"". Her book ""American Cosmic"" explores UFO phenomena and suggests a reevaluation of what we consider real, influenced by her travels to supposed UFO crash sites and the Vatican Archive. Yet, a critical review from The Daily Grail highlights moments in her book that seem to border on the fantastical, with Pasulka's skepticism seemingly melting away in the face of charismatic individuals and mystical claims.

It's concerning how Pasulka, while starting with a skeptical stance, appears to become more a believer than an impartial scholar as her narrative unfolds. Her work, as outlined in her own pages, spans a wide range of interests, from the Catholic tradition to UFOs and human potentials, capturing international acclaim. But what credibility do these claims hold when they venture too far into the realm of pseudoscience and speculation without concrete evidence?

Pasulka's engagement with media and her insights on how digital technologies influence belief systems are noteworthy. However, when her analysis ventures into the acceptance of UFOs and extraterrestrials as an emergent form of religion or belief system, based largely on personal anecdotes and encounters with questionable evidence, it's hard not to see this as a clever ploy to captivate the imagination of the public rather than contribute to genuine scholarly discourse.

The rave reviews and praise from various corners might convince some of her legitimacy, but when you peel back the layers, what's left is a narrative teeming with sensationalism more fitting for science fiction than academic research. The leap from skepticism to belief, documented in her own journey, seems less like a transformation and more like a carefully orchestrated move to gain foothold in the booming UFOlogy community.

In summary, while Diana Pasulka presents herself as a pioneering scholar navigating the uncharted territories of UFOs and spirituality, a closer look reveals a narrative rife with speculative leaps, personal anecdotes taking the place of empirical evidence, and a trajectory that seems to align more with cultivating a following than contributing to academic knowledge. As we continue to quest for truth in a world brimming with mysteries, it's crucial we remain vigilant, questioning not just the phenomena but those who claim to be its gatekeepers.

2023-11-28 08:48:20,"TIKHistory wrongly claims twelfth century Italian abbot Joachim of Fiore was a communist Gnostic who inspired Hegel, Marx, & Hitler **Introduction**

This post is directed at TIKHistory's video “The REAL Religion behind National Socialism,” YouTube, 25 April 2023. Apparently the ""real religion behind National Socialism"" was Gnosticism.

Nearly eight minutes into his video The REAL Religion behind National Socialism, popular military history Youtuber TIKHistory says he’s going to “ask you guys to take a bit of a leap of faith”, adding “you need to accept the premise that there is a huge ancient religion that does exist, but that you’ve probably never heard of it”.

Citing the Freemasons, Illuminati, and Theosophists, he says “all these “cults” have something in common; they are denominations of this ancient and prehistoric religion”. That’s quite a leap of faith he’s asking for, and you might wonder why faith is necessary. So does he have any evidence for this claim, or is he just making a religious appeal? Let’s find out.

**TIK hasn't read Joachim of Fiore's writings**

TIK starts by introducing us to the twelfth century Italian abbot Joachim of Fiore, saying “read the Bible and decided to reinterpret it. He believed that the trinity of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, symbolised the three stages of history”.\[1\] This is kind of true. Joachim believed in three stages of history, but did not believe they were the only stages of history. TIK doesn’t understand this, because he doesn’t really know what Joachim was basing this on in the first place. This will become very important later.

TIK tells us this; emphasis mine.

>The first period was the Father, which was the time before Jesus came along. The second period was the Son, which is when Jesus appeared. And then the third age was the Holy Spirit. This, he said, would begin in 1260, **because why not**.\[2\]

This is how we know TIK hasn’t read Joachim and doesn’t really understand how Joachim formed his chronology. I happened to have read Joachim’s actual work, and studied both his writings and numerous commentaries on them, both historical and modern, over a couple of years, so I can say with all fairness that I am considerably better informed on Joachim than TIK. I also know exactly how TIK has been led astray in his understanding of Joachim; it’s a result of him being uncritical with his sources, but we’ll get to that later.

Joachim wasn’t simply interpreting the Bible, he was interpreting a very specific part of the Bible, the book of Revelation, traditionally the last book of the New Testament.  In that book the number 1,260 appears, along with the period forty two months, which is another way of saying 1,260 days, and the period time times and half a time, which is three and a half years, another way of saying 1,260 days. \[3\]

Early Christian commentators had long since identified these as not literal days, but symbolic time periods. Consequently, when Joachim interpreted them as years he was in fact simply following previously principles of biblical interpretation which earlier Christians had already established. It is essential to understand this, because so much of Joachim’s interpretation of Revelation is based on the work of earlier Christian and even Jewish commentators.

He wasn’t simply making it up as he went along, and he was absolutely not a Gnostic. His interpretation of Revelation was entirely within standard Christian historicist conventions of interpretation which had been established by earlier Christian commentators from the second century onwards, such as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus of Lyons, Hippolytus of Rome, and Victorinus of Pettau. Joachim’s interpretation of Revelation was thoroughly Christian.\[4\]

In fact Nerses of Lambron, the archbishop of Tarsus and one of Joachim’s contemporaries, interpreted the 1,260 days of Revelation 12:6 as 1,260 years just as Joachim did, though he believed they would end in the return of Jesus Christ.\[5\] So Joachim’s selection of this period wasn’t simply a matter of “why not”, it was a product of his expository technique, which itself is essential to understand in order to understand his actual meaning of Revelation, and the true meaning of his tripartite chronology, which TIK has completely misinterpreted. Let’s look at that now.

TIK writes that Joachim believed that in the future he would “lead a priestly brotherhood who would have the Holy Spirit of God descend into them from the heavens” and ""transform into new men, and usher in the new age... where they would all live together without the need for institutional authority (aka the State)"".\[6\]

Notice how TIK sneaks in the phrase “new men”, as well as the term “institutional authority”, which he further explicates as “the state”. That’s TIK reading his own ideas back into Joachim’s words. Joachim didn’t write anything like that, but TIK is trying to argue that Joachim held Gnostic beliefs which the Nazis would also hold later, so he deliberately gives the impression that Joachim used words which sound like words the Nazis would use, to make his listeners believe that Joachim and the Nazis both held these same supposedly Gnostic beliefs. We’re going to see him do that a lot in his video, tweaking a word here, adding a word there, massaging the sources so they sound the way he wants.

Now to be completely fair to TIK I don’t believe he’s being deliberately deceptive here. It’s just that he is reading a source with a preconceived conclusion, and I already know why this is happening. TIK is being influenced partly by an academic work on Gnosticism and Hermeticism which he discovered through Youtuber James Lindsay, who misrepresented what the book said about Gnosticism, so TIK has the wrong idea about Gnosticism, and partly by a book published in 1952 by the German American philosopher Eric Voegelin, who completely misunderstood both Gnosticism and Joachim. TIK has been led astray by his sources, which he didn’t fact check.

**TIK misrepresents Joachim's prophecy**

So let’s return to Joachim. He didn’t write anything about a class of new men who would embrace a community of spirituality and all live together without institutional authority, whether in the form of the state or otherwise. Firstly, he wrote about God’s Holy Spirit being given specifically to Franciscan monks, one of the Catholic religious orders. These are the only “new men” of whom he wrote, and they weren’t merely men; they are described explicitly as both men and women.

Of course he never actually calls them new men, he calls them “the new people of God”, meaning a new order of monks and nuns. They’re supposed to be mostly involved in manual labor, prayer, tending to the sick and poor, and reading and studying the Bible to gain more knowledge, though Joachim says some of them won’t be smart enough to know as much as others.\[7\]

Secondly, he explicitly wrote about preserving institutional authority, specifically the institutional authority of the Church. He didn’t write of a “community of spirituality”, he wrote about a complex organization of monks and nuns in a strictly hierarchical Church hierarchy, separated into various monasteries and nunneries, some of which would have more authority over others, and within which there would be leaders with varying levels of power.

A few excerpts from his writings will illustrate this point.\[8\]

* This house will be the mother of all. The Spiritual Fathers who will be over all will be in it; all will obey his direction and authority
* In this oratory there will be learned men and also those to be instructed and taught by God (John 6:45). They desire and have more power than the others
* They will obey their Prior according to the order and will of the Spiritual Father who will be over all and who will render an account of all

Yes, this is a strict religious hierarchy, no communism here. The Christians to which he was writing would have found this instantly recognizable as a particularly stringent order of monks and nuns.

Joachim writes pages of detail about how there will be rules governing diet, times of prayer, times for and division of labor, when people are allowed to speak and when they must stay silent, who is allowed to visit, where they are allowed to go, and who is and isn’t allowed to sleep with their spouse. Breaking these rules would be punishable by expulsion. On top of all this, monks and nuns would need to pay a tithe, that is a tenth of their income, which will be given to the leader of their monastery or nunnery. Not only is this a form of taxation, it’s the opposite of common property under communism, where everything belongs to everyone else.\[9\]

Now there is a statement in this section of Joachim’s work which says “They will have food and clothing in common”,\[10\] which would probably sound like communism to TIK. But this isn’t really communism, this is just the usual communal living arrangement which was common to monasteries and nunneries of the time. It doesn’t even mean they would own the same food and clothing, or share the same clothes. It just means they would all eat the same kind of food and wear the same kind of clothing.

The closest Joachim comes to anything like true communalism, but again not even communism, is a passage in which he says that the tithes taken from “Honest and approved women” will be used “for the support of the poor and strangers, and also for the boys who are studying doctrine”. He further says that at the discretion of the Spiritual Father, “the surplus will be taken from those who have more and given to those who have less so that there may be no one in need among them but all things held in common”.\[11\]

But this only applies to these “honest and approved women” workers, not to all the men and women in the community, and their tithes are only used to support the poor, strangers, and the boys who are studying doctrine. So there is no community wide common ownership, and the only people who are given any kind of welfare are poor and strangers who are not members of the community, and the boys who are studying doctrine instead of working.

Again, this is neither communism nor socialism. Note also that the very fact that there are poor people and strangers during this third age reminds us that Joachim’s third age does not involve a worldwide utopia, only a local revival of spirituality among the Catholic Franciscan order, who would separate themselves from the corrupt Church and devote themselves to piety and the service of God, while everyone else continued to live as they always had.

Joachim goes on to remind us of just how hierarchical and anti-communist this society would be, writing that members are to “obey their Master according to the direction and order of the Spiritual Father to whom all these orders will be obedient like a new ark of Noah finished down to the cubit”.\[12\] Joachim also has some strong words to say about labor, writing “No idle person will be found among these Christians, someone who will not earn his bread that he may have that from which to help those in need”.\[13\] So if you don’t work, you don’t eat. No freeloaders will be permitted in this community, and no handouts will be given to community members; there’s no social security for the lazy here.

Joachim goes on to lay down even more rules about labor, including strict work quotas, writing “Let each one work at his own craft, and the individual trades and workers shall have their own foremen. Anyone who has not worked up to capacity should be called to account by the Master and censured by all”.\[14\]

So a very typical hierarchical arrangement of labor, with workers at the bottom doing the actual work, and foremen at the top telling them what to do, and if you don’t meet your work quota you’ll be called to the boss and reprimanded, just like in a typical capitalist company. Joachim has pages more of this stuff, but this is already beyond sufficient to correct TIK’s false characterization of Joachim’s future community.

TIK tells us Joachim believed this.

>""And Christ would come back to Earth and lead this community for a thousand years, just like it says in the Bible. Rather than dying and going to Heaven, it would be a Heaven on Earth. A Third Rome, if you will.""\[15\]

No. Joachim didn’t say this would be a heaven on earth instead of people dying and going to heaven. Because TIK hasn’t actually read Joachim, he doesn’t understand that the men and women living during this time period, which wouldn’t be exactly 1,000 years, Joachim believed that was a symbolic number, people would be dying and going to heaven, because this would still very much be the earth with actual mortals on it, not a heaven on earth. None of this is remotely Gnostic.

Notice also how TIK identifies Joachim’s third age as “a third Rome, if you will”. That’s another example of him sneaking in words to associate with Joachim’s writings with ideas which Joachim never had. TIK wants this “third Rome” idea because he can then connect it with the Third Reich of the Nazis, creating a false impression of a continuity of a specific apocalyptic vision from Gnosticism, through Joachim, to the Nazis.

Joachim not identify this third age as a third Rome, and it would have been incomprehensible for him to do so, since in his interpretation the wicked city of Babylon in the book of Revelation represents Rome as the seat of evil and the source of the antichrist. TIK doesn’t understand the entire context of Joachim’s interpretation of Revelation, which was his view that the Catholic Church had become corrupt and that the antichrist would be a Christian leader from Rome, within the Church itself.\[16\]

TIK also doesn’t understand Joachim wrote of an era after this third age, when Christ would return and the Last Judgement would take place, after which anyone still alive would go to heaven or hell.\[17\]

TIK further claims “Joachim of Flora got his ideas from previous scholars which he translated, and their ideas were influential in the underground secret societies of the time, until they came to surface in the 12th and 13th Centuries”.\[18\]

It’s true that Joachim’s ideas mainly came from previous scholars, but they were Christian interpreters of Revelation whose works were not “influential in the underground secret societies of the time”. Notice how TIK never even names any of these supposed underground secret societies, because he doesn't have any idea what he's talking about. Joachim certainly didn’t get his ideas from the Gnostics.

TIK then says this.

>""But you should also note the four elements of Joachim of Flora’s ideas which are still floating around to this day. The first being that there were three stages of history, like what Hegel, Hitler and Marx laid out; primitive communism, class society, and then final communism.""\[19\]

He takes this virtually word for word from political philosopher Eric Voegelin’s 1952 book The New Science of Politics: An Introduction. Voegelin claimed Joachim’s interpretation had four symbols, the first of which was the idea of history divided into there eras. Voegelin claims that this tripartite view of history later morphed into the Enlightenment view of ancient, medieval, and modern history, as well as “Hegel's dialectic of the three stages of freedom and self-reflective spiritual fulfilment; the Marxian dialectic of the three stages of primitive communism, class society, and final communism; and, finally, the National Socialist symbol of the Third Realm”.\[20\]

Voegelin never provides any evidence for this claim, and the idea that all three of these very different systems of thought all borrowed from Joachim’s division of history, despite the fact that none of them have anything in common except that they all count three of something, is absurd.

Of course Joachim’s three stages of history aren’t remotely describing a historical sequence of primitive communism, class society, and then final communism. Joachim didn’t even think in terms of these socio-economic categories, his text is a theological interpretation of a spiritual book, and the stages of history he describes have a strictly theological and spiritual basis. His whole idea of dividing history into three is based on the three persons of the Trinity, not three socio-economic systems. He describes the first stage, the era of the Father, as when humanity was under law, specifically the Law of Moses, since he sees God the Father as a lawgiver and authority.

He describes the second stage, the era of the Son, as when humanity was freed from the Law of Moses and came under grace, since he sees God the Son, that is Jesus Christ, as the bringer of grace and abolisher of the Law of Moses. He describes the third stage, the era of the Holy Spirit, as the era of spiritual enlightenment from God, since he sees God the Holy Spirit as the means by which God inspires faithful members of the clergy to understand His Word. None of this is anything like the Enlightenment division of history, or Hegel’s dialectic, or Marx’s theory of socio-economic development, or the Nazis’ Third Reich.

**TIK relies on an unreliable source**

It's important to understand why Voegelin was so bad at understanding Joachim. The problem was, at the time Voegelin was writing he had very little access to Joachim’s original works, so he was relying on the writings of secondary sources, scholars commenting on the various parts of Joachim’s commentaries which were available. Gnostic scholar Fryderyk Kwiatkowski comments “Most of the editorial endeavors toward publishing Joachim’s main works have been initiated only after Voegelin died in 1985”, so Voegelin was extremely under informed about what Joachim really believed.\[21\]

Later TIK provides this quotation.

>“To be sure, Hitler’s millennial prophecy authentically derives from Joachitic speculation, mediated in Germany through the Anabaptist wing of the Reformation and through the Johannine Christianity of Fichte, Hegel, and Schelling.”\[22\]

As he tells us, this comes straight from Voegelin. TIK accepts this statement of Voegelin’s completely uncritically, since he is fixated on the idea of Nazism being a form of Gnostic religion, and since he is convinced that Joachim  held these Gnostic beliefs, and since he is also convinced that Joachim’s three ages inspired Hitler’s idea of a Third Reich.

But if he had actually read just a little further down the same page in Voegelin’s book, he would have found that although Voegelin believed Hitler’s idea of a 1,000 year Reich was descended from Joachim’s prophecy concerning the 1,000 years of Revelation chapter 20, Voegelin did not believe that Hitler borrowed his Third Reich idea from Joachim’s three eras of history.

On the contrary, Voegelin wrote “The National Socialist propagandists picked it up from Moeller van den Bruck's tract of that name. And Moeller, who had no National Socialist intentions, had found it as a convenient symbol in the course of his work on the German edition of Dostoevski”.\[23\]

That German term Dritte Reich means Third Reich. Now you can see why TIK wanted to associate Joachim’s third age with the idea of a Third Rome, so he can draw a line from supposedly ancient Gnosticism to Joachim’s apocalyptic millennial third age, and then from Joachim’s supposedly Gnostic apocalyptic millennial third age to the Nazis Third Reich and 1,000 year Reich. But Voegelin does not do this.

Voegelin says that the idea of a 1,000 year kingdom was inherited by the Nazis from Joachim through later German Christian groups, but not the idea of a third age, Third Reich, or Third Rome.Instead Voegelin says the idea of a third age or Third Reich was borrowed by the Nazis from the German historian and nationalist Moeller van den Bruck, whose 1923 book Das Dritte Reich literally means The Third Reich, and that van den Bruck himself had borrowed it from the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky.Voegelin also says the idea of the Third Rome was inherited by the Nazis from the Russians, writing “The Russian idea of the Third Rome is characterized by the same blend of an eschatology of the spiritual realm with its realization by a political society as the National Socialist idea of the Dritte Reich”.\[24\]

He cites a letter from Russian monk Philotheus of Pskov stating that after the first Rome fell Constantinople became the second Rome, and that after Constantiniople fell Moscow became the third Rome.\[25\] So Voegelin attributes the Nazi idea of a Third Rome or Third Reich to the Russians, not Joachim, and certainly not the Gnostics.

Now we’ve already seen that Joachim didn’t believe the 1,000 years in Revelation was actually a literal number anyway, which is something Voegelin most likely didn’t realizes himself, so it’s not even possible for the idea of a 1,000 year earthly kingdom by a state to have descended from Joachim to Hitler. Remember also that previously TIK assured us that Joachim’s vision was of a 1,000 year stateless communism, the very opposite of Hitler’s view.

2017-11-01 16:59:11,"Why the Mercy Changes Are Fantastically Designed With the Mercy hell we've been in, it feels great that we finally have a patch on the PTR. I want to take some time to discuss all of the ways the solution Blizzard went with has the potential to be perfect.

&nbsp;

Ideally, a change to resurrect (or any ability) would try to accomplish all of the following:


1. Decrease the amount of Resurrects


2. Increase the Skill Cap of the Mercy player


3. Increase the Skill Cap of Mercy's teammates by adding strategic layers


4. Increase the Skill Cap of Mercy's opponents


5. Increase Hero Diversity in the game



I think Blizzard's change maximizes all of these in great ways.

&nbsp;

Resurrect on a 2 second channel where she moves at 25% speed means she sacrifices her life if she attempts it in the middle of combat or in most non-poke phase situations. Without coordination, Resurrect will mostly be used to undo backline picks, poke phase mistakes, and long range picks. The change also solves the headache with how Mercy would Resurrect Tanks for Free, and reintroduces win conditions into the game. Killing the enemy Rein becomes a viable win condition again because a dead rein is harder to resurrect without a shield to protect you as compared to a dead squishy, who you can resurrect with the help of your anchor tank. On the margins, we'll see the occasional resurrect in more combat heavy situations which will be really clutch.

&nbsp;

The situational nature of Resurrect in turn raises the **skill ceiling of Mercy**. Having to determine where to position yourself to pull off a resurrect quickly before the enemy team takes over that space becomes important. Tracking your reinhardt's shield or your Zarya's bubble, or seeing whether a big CC Ult opens a window for you to pull off a Resurrect enters into the mix. Additionally, because you wont be using a resurrect whenever its on cooldown, you can make decisions on who to heal and who to ""let go of"" in situations where someone on your team is going to have to die. In the old patch, it didn't really matter who you chose to save with healing vs save with resurrect, but now you might favor saving your Rein with healing over saving your Mccree, since the latter can be easily resurrected. Finally, Resurrecting someone means spending about 3 seconds not healing your team (a second to target select and fly in, and two seconds to channel). That's theoretically a 3 second window where the Mercy's team is missing 180-240 healing. That represents a big opportunity for the enemy team to snowball a fight, giving the mercy even harder decisions to plan out.

&nbsp;

The new resurrect **considerably raises the skill ceiling of Mercy's team**. To get the Resurrect you are looking for, you will need a Rein/Orisa shield, Defense Matrix or a well timed Zarya bubble in heat of the moment situations. One thing that was debated endlessly was, should a Resurrect Channel ability stop when Mercy receives damage, and I'm so glad they chose to make it so it still goes through.

&nbsp;

Because damage doesn't cancel out a Resurrect, a team can use Sound Barrier, Zenyatta Ult, and maybe even Nano Boost with focused healing to secure the resurrect. On top of that, certain offensive ultimates like Whole Hog, Dead Eye, Earth Shatter, Mei Ult, Diva Bomb and Grav can be used to create a window to pull off a resurrect. All it takes is coordination and synergy.

&nbsp;

Similarly, the channel design **raises the skill ceiling of the opposing team**. There is the obvious fact that a resurrecting Mercy is an easy and high priority pick. But on top of that, when a Mercy is channeling a resurrect, there is a 3-4 second window where Mercy’s team is receiving no healing and snowballing a fight is manageable. Because Boops, Stuns, and Hacks will cancel out a Resurrect, a well-protected Mercy is still vulnerable but not so easily that it can be done thoughtlessly. Based on [this gif]( https://gfycat.com/gifs/detail/DaringScholarlyJay) we can see that Mercy can negate some of the knockback she receives meaning not every form of knockback will be enough. This is a good thing, since if a Lucio boop could knock Mercy out of resurrect, we’d probably see Lucio as a must pick again.  However, I’m willing to wager a Doomfist punch, or a Lucio boop coordinated with a Diva Dive/Winston Leap might be enough. Forcing this type of coordinated commitment on the part of the opposing team, but only If Mercy’s team are themselves coordinated creates an intricate web of interactions that excites me to see.

&nbsp;

Finally, I want to talk about how the changes will **impact compositions.** If Resurrect was truly bad and brainless to counter (with a Lucio boop for example), we’d see her completely replaced by Ana/Zen/Lucio. But now, we can justify any pair of support characters, including Ana + Mercy since dedicated burst focused healing from Ana can allow Mercy to pull off crucial resurrects.


&nbsp;


Second of all, Mercy will be relatively ineffective within Dive compositions, and her resurrect will most easily be used to counter backline picks from Tracer. In this way, she can soft counter the efforts of one of the most impactful least counterable characters. These changes act as a soft nerf to dive and opens the flexibility of shield based hero compositions, especially Orisa whose shield stays up even after she dies, and Zarya, who was used a meager 5% of the time in APAC (barely more than Doomfist). The existence of Mercy increases the viability of more niche picks as well:

&nbsp;

For example, Mei’s Ice wall may be one of the best tools to allow for a resurrect window. Torbjorn, who usually stands far away enough from the action can be flexibility resurrected, and he provides armor to give a Mercy some survivability during a resurrect. Bastion based comps that always rely on a shield have more potential. I can easily see shield based compositions come back into play in a big way.

&nbsp;

As you can tell, I’m really excited with the changes and I’m super glad they went with a channel that doesn’t cancel with damage. I think this could, in the long run, be a great change for making Mercy have a viable role in compositions while adding a lot of strategic depth to her ceiling.

2025-06-28 01:36:56,"An Otherworldly Scholar [LitRPG, Isekai] - Chapter 231 Malkah’s team had escaped from Astur’s cadets, but the moment of respite was short. After a few sharp turns and deceitfully similar corridors, they stumbled upon a swarm of Rustclaws led by a huge Alpha. The boys couldn’t turn back for fear of meeting the cadets, so their only way out was to fight. Odo and Harwin were drained, so Malkah took the lead, the two of them covering his flanks. His lack of skills—and proper weapons—made the combat painfully slow, even with the Alpha Rustclaw waiting in the background for their prey to get tired. 

A small Rustclaw managed to pass through Odo’s defenses and catch Malkah unprepared. The boy raised his hands to protect his face, and the Rustclaw buried its claws into his flesh. Malkah clenched his teeth as the blood dripped down his arm. Out of nowhere, fiery-red mana surrounded his body. The Bloordreaver power-up was immediate. Malkah shook the mutant rat from his arm and kicked the one in front of him, violently sending it against the hedge despite its weight. 

The Alpha Rustclaw stood up on its hindquarters, still just observing the fight. 

“Lord Malkah! Please stand behind me!” Odo grunted as his \[Steadfast Shield\] flickered against the blows of two Rustclaws. 

Odo and Zaon were both Sentinels, although their approaches to their Class were completely opposite. Zaon was a nimble warrior who used his skills to create opportunities for his attacks. Odo, on the other hand, stood firmly on the ground, creating an impassable wall between allies and foes. It wasn’t hard to guess Odo’s \[Sentinel’s Oath\] was aimed at protecting his lord.

Malkah ignored Odo, dashing forward and passing through the Rustclaws to slash at the Alpha’s stomach. His red mana gleaming on his blade looked like blood. The Alpha Rusclaw pounced at the boy, but it was too slow. Malkah stepped aside and buried his knife into the iron mane like a matador stabbing a bull.

The Alpha Rustclaw stumbled as blood poured onto the ground in torrents. 

Malkah’s eyes turned red as he stepped forward and slashed the creature’s neck. More blood splattered across the ground. Either he had carefully studied the position of the Rustclaws’ vital arteries, or he had a detection skill. Nobody could be that lucky.

Odo pushed his way toward Malkah’s while Harwin shot \[Mana Arrows\] from the other side of the corridor. The arrows were only half as effective without a bow, but it was better than nothing. 

The Rustclaws entered a state of confusion as their formation broke.

A moment later, the Alpha Rustclaw stopped moving, and the swarm broke apart.

Malkah was bleeding, but at least they were able to catch their breath.

“Lord Malkah, have my potion,” Harwin said, rummaging through his pouch.

“Save it,” Malkah replied. “Let \[Fleshknit\] do some work while I have mana to spare.”

The Alpha Rustclaw faded into mana specks, leaving a shiny totem behind.

Odo snatched it and put it in his pocket.

“Let’s move, before the hedge decides to swallow us.” Malkah jogged down the corridor, away from the fountain room, not waiting for Odo and Harwin. 

The henchmen set off a moment later.

Malka’s \[Bloodreaver\] was a blessing and a curse. At the start of a fight, he was more of a liability than an asset. They would've been overrun without Odo and Harwin keeping the Rustclaws at bay. Luckily, the boys have good crowd control skills. However, the moment Malkah got wounded, his skills skyrocketed. I dared to say he was Leonie's only rival in the Cabbage Class. The boy had even gone toe-to-toe with a Lv.1 Zaon during our introductory match. However, the downside of his Class was too big to ignore.

“Who even came up with the Bloodreaver Class?” I asked.

The System Avatar remained silent.

Hours advanced painfully slowly, and regardless of the Corrupted Gloomstalker, no other instructor climbed down the watchtower. I tried to keep an eye on Holst’s cadets whenever I could. I had only seen them once, when I visited Holst’s classroom, but that had been enough for \[Foresight\] to store their faces in my brain. 

Luckily for Malkah and the henchmen, as time passed, and cadets dealt with the monsters, traversing the corridors became easier. The greatest threat was Astur’s group, but Harwin seemed to have a sixth sense for danger, and he steered the group into safe corridors and depleted fountain rooms. 

The downside was that fewer monsters prowled around, which meant fewer chances to get totems.

My inner clock told me six hours had passed since the start of the exam. A hundred cadets had already been flushed out of the maze, and a small army of Librarians of the Nature Circle helped them tend to their wounds.

“Lord Malkah, please. Let’s stop for a moment. You have to rest,” Odo said.

The fight for the sixth totem had a high mana price. The boys were exhausted, and their already low mana pools were now dangerously empty. Their earlier fight with Astur’s cadets had turned the tide against them.

Despite the deep cuts on his arm, the bruises on his back, and the dry blood on his face, Malkah ignored them and pushed down the corridor. Odo and Harwin had to cling to his shoulders to stop him, but the red Bloodreaver mana gave Malkah enough strength to drag them for meters before stopping.

“Let me go. We still have work to do!”

They had only collected six totems—none from fountain monsters—and the number of corridor monsters holding totems had seemingly dwindled to near zero.

“Lord Malkah, please,” Harwin said. “It’s enough. We have enough.”

“Your math is incorrect, Odo. We need twelve.”

“We have enough!”

Malkah stopped and turned around. Despite his wounds, he seemed completely lucid, almost like his body—or his Class—had completely shut out the pain. His eyes jumped from Odo to Harwin, back and forth, looking for an explanation.

“Lord Malkah, with all due respect, two scrubs like us will not become Imperial Knights. Reaching this point is already beyond anything we ever aspired to be,” Harwin said, pulling a potion from his pouch. “Four totems are enough for you to pass. We even have two for Rup or some other idiot who needs them.”

“Fenwick might need all of them,” Odo pointed out.

“Or Yvain. House Osgiria might have cash, but they lack the bravery of House Stormvale.”

Malkah massaged his eyes.

“You can’t be serious. We already got this far.”

“We are here to help you, Young Master, but there’s only so much we can do before becoming a burden,” Harwin said. “You are in good hands. Instructor Clarke is a good man. He will treat you well, and the others are not bad either. You won’t need us anymore.”

Malkah opened his mouth to protest, but the ground trembled.

The hedge walls shook, filling the corridor with tiny leaves.

Suddenly, roots burst through the ground and coiled together into a humanoid form.

**Thorned Sapling Lv.10 (Corrupted) \[Identify\]: A highly territorial creature formed by corrupted mana-loaded roots of plants possessed by Forest Spirits. It will attack anything considered a threat to their commanding Spirit. Weakness: Fire, Drain.**

Harwin looked at the sky.

“The sixth hour! The extraction phase has commenced!”

“They aren’t going to make it easy for us, huh?” Odo replied.

Malkah’s blood evaporated into small mana shards in the air around him as more and more Thorned Saplings emerged from the ground.

“Which way?” Malkah shouted, the shards quivering as he held back from firing them..

“East!” Harwin replied without even looking at the map.

Malkah turned around and unleashed a barrage of crimson shards into the nearest Sapling. The boy’s skill wasn’t all that different from my \[Mana Mastery\], except that he could strengthen his body. The first Sapling was reduced to splinters, and Malkah focused on the next monster. Odo and Harwin followed, the boys opening a path before they could be completely surrounded.

Harwin led the group away from the Thorned Saplings, but Astur wouldn’t make it easy for them. New summoned monsters plagued both the corridors and the depleted fountain rooms to replace those which had been defeated. If my hunch was correct, none of them had totems to drop. Not only would extraction be more difficult with all the new monsters, but finding extra totems would be nearly impossible.

Malkah seemed to have the same realization because he finally capitulated.

“Avoid any unnecessary fights. We are not going to get any more totems,” he said. “I’m sorry.”

Odo channeled his \[Steadfast Shield\] and rammed through a group of unsuspecting chubby Mana Stingers, grinning.

“Don’t apologize, Lord Malkah. You led us well.”

The boys headed back to the Dreadshade fountain room, but their way was interrupted by monster patrols. After the Thorned Saplings and the Mana Stingers, they stumbled into short and stumpy Sandstone Golems and a swarm of Rustclaws. The silver lining was that the monster's presence faded the closer they got to the fountain—most of the new monsters spawned near the exits on the northern side of the maze.

“We should be there after the next turn.” Harwin huffed.

The boy spoke too soon because the same two cadets from Astur’s Class appeared around the corner, blocking their path. Malkah, Odo, and Harwin were dangerously near exhaustion, covered in dirt, bruises, and dry blood. On the contrary, Astur’s cadets seemed well-rested and, strangely enough, their black uniforms were unreasonably tidy.

I counted fifteen shiny totems in one of the cadet’s pockets—five more than in their previous confrontation.

“Let us through! You have enough totems already, and we don’t want trouble,” Odo said.

Astur’s students exchanged a confused glance.

“You seem to be under the false pretense that we are merely trying to complete the test,” the cadet who had used the ice spells against the Stone Golem said. “That’s a given. We are trying to score best in our Class, so hand over the totems and we will let you go.”

Odo raised his \[Steadfast Shield\], but the spell quivered due to lack of mana.

“Tell your lackey to hand the totems and return to your cozy home, little dukeling,” the ice cadet said. “Return to Papa. You don’t belong here.”

Malkah stepped forward as crimson mana flowed into his knife, making it grow until it became the size of a longsword. Surprisingly, Odo and Harwin moved aside instead of trying to stop him. Malkah’s impassive mask had disappeared. His jaw was tight, and his eyes burned with a passion I didn’t believe possible until now.

Instead of the hedgehog stance of the Kigrian Knights, Malkah raised his blade into *vom tag—*his arms high and steady as the longsword angled over his shoulder. The crimson mana along the blade gleamed like heat off a kiln.

“You know nothing about me.”

The ice cadet lunged, his frosted knife blade moving in a tight arc, aiming at Malkah’s face. Malkah didn’t retreat. He stepped into the strike, twisting his hips as he brought the sword down in a brutal diagonal strike from *vom tag*. Crimson mana screeched against magical ice. The force of Malkah’s blow drove the ice cadet’s blade down.

In one fluid movement, Malkah pivoted, turning the initial cut into a circular motion and trapping his opponent's blade in a tight bind. With a flick of his wrist and a subtle shift of his feet, the cadet was off-balance. The back of Malkah’s hand struck the ice cadet across the face with a loud crack. The swords released from the bind, and the cadet stumbled back onto the ground, blood smearing his face.

The wind cadet was already upon Malkah, leaping high, his \[Gust Blade\] causing the air to tremble. Odo stepped forward, but a giant icicle hit his side, sending him against the hedge. Vines coiled around his chest and wrists, threatening to drown him in the green wall. Harwin rushed to help him.

Malkah parried the \[Gust Blade\], but a dozen minor cuts appeared on his skin. In that moment, the ice cadet struck, freezing the ground around Malkah and locking him in place. Above, the wind cadet used \[Aerokinesis\] to shift mid-air, driving his knee hard into Malkah’s face. The boy’s crimson mana flickered as he drifted in and out of consciousness. Finally, he fell to the ground.

Harwin finished pulling Odo from the vines while Astur’s cadets passed by Malkah’s side.

“The totems, Big One. Now.”

“You will pay for this,” Odo panted.

Malkah’s mana flickered as he regained a sliver of consciousness and struggled to get back on his feet. He clenched his teeth. His body refused to obey him, like his joints were made of stone. 

Suddenly, Ilya jumped the hedge and landed on my side.

“Didn’t I tell you to look over Leonie?” I asked.

Ilya pointed to the east.

The crack of thunder echoed through the corridor as a lightning whip struck the wind cadet square in the chest. Leonie panted, her straight white hair tangled into a frizzy mess, and her uniform mangled like she had been thrown into a clothes dryer with them on. The ice cadet raised a crystalline ice wall, but Leonie’s spell shattered it with a flick of her wrist.

Aeliana darted into the corridor, three daggers floating over her head, each like a scorpion stinger, with Kili by her side. 

Astur’s cadets jumped into a defensive formation, showing no trace of fear. They seemed confident of winning a two-on-five combat. They locked in the fight like the outcome had already been decided. 

Aeliana engaged the wind cadet, pushing him away from Odo, while Kili focused on dodging icicles and closing the gap between her and the ice cadet.

The bravado of Astur’s cadet was quickly shattered when the rest of Cabbage Class appeared around the eastern corner as well.

Genivra used \[Wind Step\] to shoot forward, followed by Yvain and Rup’s puppet. Kili, Fenwick, and Cedrinor brought up the rear. Each one of them was dirty and bruised, like they had wrestled bears in the mud. Considering the glowing blades and the defensive skills, they still had some fuel in the tank.

Astur’s cadets were smart enough to retreat as soon as the tides turned. The wind cadet shot himself across the corridor like a bullet with \[Aerokinesis\], and the ice cadet used one of his ice pillars to the same effect. A moment later, the two cadets disappeared, leaving behind a frozen trail that made any attempt to chase extremely difficult. 

“Don’t chase them, Aeliana! They are dangerous!” Kili yelled.

“They had many totem!” Aeliana complained.

Genivra helped a dizzy Malkah get on his feet. He was still groggy from the blow to his face and had trouble balancing. The boy blinked repeatedly, like he was trying to focus his gaze.

“You need a potion, man,” Genivra said.

“I’m fine,” Malkah replied, almost dropping to his knees.

Without warning, Rup grabbed Malkah’s bloody nose, pulled his head back, and plugged the potion vial into his mouth. Malkah coughed, but the potion went down. An instant later, Odo and Harwin stepped between the girl and their lord, albeit fairly gently.

“Step back, furball! That’s not how you treat the future lord of Stormvale!” Odo said.

Rup glared at him.

“Look at the state your lord is! You should be ashamed of calling yourself a loyal subject of the Kigrian dukedom!”

The others agreed with Rup’s assessment.

Malkah was far from okay, but the potion seemed to revitalize it enough to walk on its own.

“Let’s go,” Leonie interrupted them. “The vines will only give us thirty-seven seconds before they attack us, and we have already spent twenty.”

The cadets nodded and walked down the hall into the fountain room. Meanwhile, Talindra and Zaon joined me. They seemed relieved the kids had finally gathered.

“I’m definitely not cut out to be a teacher,” Zaon pointed out.

“You’ll learn to trust your students,” I replied, patting his shoulder.

We followed the cadets. They sat around the fountain, drinking water, cleaning their wounds, and munching on jerky. Although only six hours had passed since the start of the exam, they looked like they hadn’t slept or eaten in a week. Kili and Genivra stood on opposite sides of the fountain, somewhat apart from the rest, guarding the entrances. 

“Fountain rooms aren’t safe places anymore, so let’s debrief quickly,” Leonie said, taking the lead and putting her map on the edge of the fountain. “We found two exits. One is on the northern side, and the other is on the western side, both near the corner of the maze. We gathered nine totems.”

Yvain stepped forward, holding his map next to Leonie’s.

“We found an exit northeast of here, but there were a lot of cadets around. It might be extremely crowded. Even the fountain rooms were ransacked early over there,” he said. “We found only eleven totems. We are one short.”

Leonie nodded.

“It’s okay, we have one to spare.”

“You are a woman of honor,” Yvain said with a slight bow.

Leonie bowed back and turned to Cedrinor.

“The eastern section is a no-go zone. We spent more time avoiding other squads than actually fighting monsters. It has to be the most well-documented area of the maze,” the boy said, showing his map. “Everyone except Basilisk Class seems to see us as an easy pick, so I advise avoiding this area. We only got ten totems. We are two short.”

Fenwick babbled something I couldn’t understand. I hadn’t realized, but his face was completely swollen. Talindra told me he had been stung by a Mana Stinger, and he seemed to be experiencing a severe allergic reaction. At least Dolores had appeared in his moment of greatest need.

I focused back on the fountain room.

“What about you, Honored Heir?” Aeliana said.

The group turned towards Malkah, but Odo spoke first.

“We didn’t get to find any exits, but we have two totems to spare.”

His statement raised some eyebrows.

“You are not seriously telling me the three of you collected fourteen totems?!” Cedrinor said.

Harwin put his hands on his hips and huffed.

“First of all, disrespectful. Second of all, we would’ve collected twenty totems if those idiots from Astur’s Class hadn’t chased us!”

Odo pushed him away.

“We collected six totems—four for Lord Malkah, two to spare,” he said.

The chattering suddenly died.

“What about you two?” Rup asked, horrified.

“We only came here to help Lord Malkah get settled in.” Odo shrugged.

Rup punched Odo’s ribs, just where the Astur cadet’s icicle had hit him, making the boy bend over and groan in pain. 

“We can steal from someone! There are eleven of us!”

“Too risky. There are a hundred things that can go wrong. Someone could get injured and swallowed by the vines, or we could lose our totems. The rabble has already been eliminated. Only the most dangerous cadets remain in the game, and most squads have double the numbers of Cabbage Class,” Odo grunted. “Let it be, munchkin. We are out.”

Nobody spoke, each silently weighing the henchmen’s decision. 

Out of nowhere, Kili dropped from the ruined statue.

“We won’t need to fight,” she said with a devilish grin. Then, she put her hand in her pocket and pulled a handful of totems. “I helped myself to a little gift while they tried to escape. They seemed to be in a rush, so I thought I could ease their load.”

The world seemed to stop. I hadn’t even realized Kili had stolen from Astur’s cadet. Down in the fountain room, Harwin and Odo tried to hug Kili, but the girl slipped through them like a slippery mouse.

Malkah bowed, unable to hide his smile.

“House Kigria is in debt with you—”

Before he could finish the sentence, Odo forced him to straighten, and Harwin covered his mouth with both hands.

“You won’t get the favor of House Stormvale or the Kigrian Dukedom so easily! This one is on us!” Harwin said defensively.

“Yeah! This one is on us!” Odo added, even more defensively.

Kili rolled her eyes.

“Whatever, you weirdos.”

Ultimately, the group decided to use one of the exits on the north-west side of the maze. We followed from the top of the wall, heart in hand. Groups of cadets still traversed the corridors, hoping to find leftover totems, but the newly summoned monsters served to hide the original ones. Most seemed to realize their best bet was to ambush unsuspecting groups near the exit points.

“Two groups at three and four o’clock, non-scavengers, probably. One at twelve, scavengers for sure. Over there, two groups are spying on the exit, non-scavengers,” Kili said as Cabbage Class stopped by a shadowy passage in the hedge wall. In front of them, there was a thirty-meter clearing with sparse columns and naked half-walls. The place was designed for ambushes.

“We can probably fight one or two groups,” Genivra said.

“We should wait for them to fight with each other. We still have time,” Yvain replied.

“There’s another way,” Cedrinor said, stepping outside their hideout.

Two cadets with the insignia of Astur’s Class jumped from behind the column. A dozen totems shone through one of their pockets. The other scavenger teams shyly approached, smelling blood. 

“What is he doing?!” Leonie whispered.

“Flaunting Mister Clarke’s gift,” Rup sighed, following Cedrinor outside the cover. “Let’s go. He knows what he’s doing.”

One by one, Cabbage Class emerged from the hedge until the eleven of them were in plain sight. Astur’s cadets stopped short, their mana signature suddenly disappearing. They examined Cabbage Class and seemed to realize they had no chance against eleven foes. 

Seeing the elite cadets retreating, the other scavengers imitated them.

“That’s what I thought! Scrubs!” Cedrinor said, tossing a rude gesture in their general direction.

Kili, Rup, and Rup’s puppet joined the rude gesturing.

I made a mental note to teach them about humility in victory.

“That’s the power of friendship.” Ilya grinned.

“That’s being a bad winner,” I replied.

One way or another, the eleven cadets from Cabbage Class crossed the finish line, each with four totems in their pocket.

2025-06-19 21:47:07,"I'm the developer of a ghost-hunting app. I'm writing this to explain why I destroyed it, and to beg you not to make the same mistake I did. Three months ago, I permanently deleted every file associated with a project I called Aura. I
wiped the cloud repository, scrubbed the backups from my local drives, and then physically
destroyed the hard drives with a drill press in my garage. The noise the drill made, that
high-pitched scream as it bit into the magnetic platters, is one of the few sounds that can drown
out the ringing in my ears. I am writing this now, under a name that isn't mine, from a city I've
never lived in before, because last night I saw an article about a new augmented reality game
that's about to launch. The description of its ""dynamic environmental interaction engine""
sounded terrifyingly familiar. It made me realize my silence is a luxury I can't afford. My silence
could get someone else killed.

I live in a small, furnished apartment now. The kind that's designed for transient people. The
furniture is bland and impersonal, which is how I like it. There are no pictures on the walls, no
sentimental clutter. Everything I own fits into two suitcases. I have rituals. I check the three
deadbolts on my door every hour. I never sit in a chair that has its back to a doorway. I've
covered the reflective screen of the television with a thick blanket. I sleep with a salt lamp on,
not because I believe it does anything, but because its dim, orange glow means I never have to
wake up in complete darkness. The silence of this place is the hardest part. It's a deep,
profound quiet that my brain constantly tries to fill. Every creak of the floorboards, every groan
of the plumbing in the walls, becomes a question. Is that just the building settling? Or is it
something else?

Aura was supposed to be my answer to all that. My way out. It was supposed to be a
ghost-hunting app, but that was just the marketing angle. The concept itself isn't original, I know.
The app store is flooded with them, cheap toys that flash random numbers and play spooky
sounds. Mine was just going to be better. More elegant. I wasn't a believer; I was a programmer,
and a damn good one. And to a programmer, the universe is a system with rules. I saw the
paranormal not as a spiritual phenomenon, but as a predictable glitch in human perception. The
eye seeing faces in wood grain, the ear hearing whispers in static. This is called pareidolia, and
I believed I could code an engine that would replicate those patterns on demand.
The goal was to create the most convincing illusion of the supernatural ever coded. The app
would use a phone's camera and microphone, but the data it collected was mostly a
smokescreen. The real work was done by my algorithm. It would analyze the visual input for any
random noise, pixel artifacts, lens flare, dust motes, and subtly enhance them into faint,
smoky shapes that looked vaguely like figures. The audio component did the same, stringing
together snippets of white noise to create the impression of voices. It was a fake. A clever one,
but a fake. My masterpiece of deception.

My best friend, Mark, was my only beta tester. He was my opposite in almost every way. I saw
the world as a complex machine to be understood; he saw it as a magical story to be
experienced. We'd been friends since our freshman year of college, bonded by a shared love for
late-night sci-fi movies and cheap pizza. I remember one night, we were walking back to our
dorm through a misty field on campus, and Mark stopped dead. He pointed at a gnarled old oak
tree. ""Doesn't it look like it's watching us?"" he'd whispered, his voice filled with genuine awe. I'd
laughed and pulled out my phone, taking a picture and explaining the precise way the shadows
and the fog were creating the illusion of a face in the bark. He just shook his head, smiling. ""You
see the code, Leo,"" he said. ""I see the ghost in the machine."" I think, in a way, I was building
Aura for him. I was trying to prove my point, to show him the code behind the ghost, but maybe I
was also trying to give him the magic he so desperately wanted to see.

He was my biggest supporter. He didn't see a cynical cash grab; he saw a genuine tool for
discovery. He was the one who pushed me, texting me links to local ""haunted"" places and
begging me to try the app there. One of his favorites was the old Blackwood Mill on the edge of
town, a derelict textile factory that had been rotting since the fifties. ""The EMF fluctuations there
would be off the charts!"" he'd text. I always patiently explained that the increased background
noise in an old, drafty building would just give the algorithm more random data to work with,
creating better fakes. It was a feature, not a bug.

For the first few weeks of the beta test, it was fun. It was our game. He'd send me screenshots
of wispy figures in the corner of his room. ""I think I have a ghost in my kitchen,"" he texted one
afternoon, along with a picture showing a vague, smoky smudge hovering near his toaster.
""Does it want toast?"" I replied. He sent back a laughing emoji. ""I think it's a gluten-free ghost. It
just seems to be vibing."" I felt a swell of pride in my work. My code was working perfectly. It was
a perfect trick.

The turning point was the mill. He finally went, against my advice. He called me that night, and
the usual excitement in his voice was replaced by something else. Something tight and strained.
""Leo, I saw something,"" he said, his voice low. ""At the mill. It was different.""

I settled into my chair, ready to be the voice of reason. ""Different how?""

""It wasn't like the others,"" he said. ""The ones in my apartment are like... smoke. They drift. This
one... it was solid. It was in one of the collapsed doorways in the main weaving room. It was just
a shape, you know? A tall, black shape. But it didn't move. It just stood there. And when I
pointed my phone at it, it didn't fade. It... it stepped back. Into the shadows.""

A prickle of unease ran down my spine, but I squashed it. ""Mark, the lighting in that place must
be a nightmare. The sensors were probably getting confused, creating a hard-edged artifact
instead of a soft one. And the 'stepping back' thing was probably just the filter re-evaluating the
light as you moved.""

He was quiet for a moment. ""No,"" he said, his voice small, a raw edge to it. ""It felt like it was watching me, Leo. It felt... wrong. It's one thing for your algorithm to show me smoke, but this felt different, solid. Like it knew I was looking."" I spent the next ten minutes patiently explaining the technical reasons for what he saw. I was so sure of myself, so condescendingly logical. I can still hear the resignation in his voice when he finally gave up. ""I guess so. Still, I can't shake it. This one felt different."" That conversation haunts me now. It was his last chance, his cry for help, and I explained it away with algorithms.

A few days later, I pushed the final update to the audio feature. I'd tweaked it to sound more
""natural."" That night, my phone rang. It was 2:17 AM. I remember the exact time because my
eyes were burning from staring at lines of code and I was about to finally give up for the night. I
almost didn't answer. I wish to God I hadn't.
There was no ""hello."" Just Mark's shaky breathing and the low, crackling hum of the app. I could
picture him perfectly, sitting up in the dark, phone in hand, completely immersed in the illusion
I'd built for him.

""Leo,"" he whispered, his voice tight with a fear so profound it sounded like he was being
strangled. ""It's here. The thing from the mill is in my apartment.""

Before I could answer, a different sound came through the phone's speaker, cutting through the
static I had created. It was a voice, but it wasn't the garbled output from my audio engine. This
was clear, slow, and raspy, like something was dragging the sound out of a long-dead throat.
It said his name.

""Mark... Mark....Marrrk....""

The call dropped. In the silence that followed, I felt a cold dread wash over me. A programmer's
dread. The kind you get when your code does something it wasn't designed to do. Something
impossible. I had created a filter to fake the paranormal, and something from the other side had
just used it to speak.

My first reaction was purely technical. My mind raced through the possibilities, desperately
trying to find a logical explanation. Did the audio buffer pull a cached sound bite from another
app? Was there a memory leak causing it to access and distort a random audio file on his
phone? Could it be a prank? Was Mark playing a soundboard to mess with me? That last one
felt the most likely. It had to be. He was just getting me back for all the times I'd been a cynical
ass about his beliefs.

I texted him, ""very funny. You got me.""
No reply. The little text bubble with the three dots didn't even appear.

I texted again. ""Seriously, call me back. That was a good one.""

The empty space below my message was deafening. I called his phone. It went straight to
voicemail. That's when the programmer's dread was replaced by a more primal, human fear.
The kind that starts as a cold knot in your stomach and quickly spreads, leaving ice in its wake.
I grabbed my keys and was out the door in thirty seconds. The drive to Mark's apartment
complex usually took fifteen minutes. I think I made it in eight. Every red light was an
accusation. Every empty street corner felt like a judgment. The streetlights smeared past my
windshield like watercolor streaks. My mind was a frantic battleground between logic and terror.
Logic insisted it was a prank. An elaborate, cruel joke. But terror whispered about the sound of
that voice. The way it had stretched his name out, like it was tasting it. It wasn't a soundbite. It
sounded ancient.

I pulled into the parking lot of his building, killing the engine. The silence was heavy. His
apartment was on the third floor, corner unit. The lights were off. Of course they were off, it was
almost 2:30 in the morning. Still, it felt wrong, like the darkness in those windows was deeper
than it should be.

I took the stairs two at a time, my heart hammering against my ribs. I stood outside his door,
number 314, and listened. Nothing. I knocked, first gently, then harder.

""Mark! It's me, Leo! Open up!""

Silence.

""Come on, man, this isn't funny anymore!""

The knot in my stomach tightened. I tried the doorknob. Locked. I always carried a small
lockpick set on my keychain,a holdover from my teenage years of thinking I was a cool hacker.
It felt absurd to be using it now. My hands were shaking so badly it took me almost a minute, the
clicks and scrapes of the metal amplified in the silent hallway. I kept expecting to hear him on
the other side, laughing at me. The lock finally clicked, loud as a gunshot.

I pushed the door open. ""Mark?""

The apartment was still and dark. The air was cold and stale. I could see the familiar shapes of
his lumpy couch, his cluttered coffee table, the towering shelves of books and graphic novels.
On the coffee table was a plate with a half-eaten sandwich. Everything was in its place, but it felt
like a museum exhibit. A diorama of a life that had suddenly stopped.

""Mark, are you in your room?"" I called out, my voice sounding thin and weak.

I moved through the living room, my feet silent on the carpet. The door to his bedroom was
slightly ajar. I pushed it open.

And that's when I found him.

He was lying on his back in bed, his eyes wide open, staring at the ceiling with an expression of
profound, frozen shock. His phone was on the floor beside the bed, face up. The screen was
still on, lit by the eerie glow of my app's interface.
I think I stopped breathing. For a moment, the world dissolved into a silent, slow-motion
vignette. I saw the rumpled sheets, the way his hand was curled on the floor just inches from the
phone, the faint, almost imperceptible tremor in my own hands.

Then my lungs remembered their job and I sucked in a ragged breath. I stumbled forward, my
knees hitting the floor beside his bed. ""Mark,"" I whispered, touching his arm. He was cold. Not
just cool, but a deep, penetrating cold that felt wrong. Unnatural.

My gaze fell to the phone. Aura's interface was running, the familiar swirling blue and purple
background pulsing gently. But in the center of the screen, where the spectral shapes were
supposed to appear, was an image. It wasn't one of my fake, smoky wisps. This was sharp,
detailed, and utterly terrifying.

It was a face. Gaunt and narrow, with deep-set, empty sockets where eyes should have been.
The skin was tight over the cheekbones, like dried parchment. The mouth was a thin, lipless
slash, twisted into a silent snarl of utter malice. It was rendered in perfect, high-definition clarity
against the backdrop of Mark's own bedroom ceiling, as if the app was looking back at him from
the other side. It was a predator's face. And it was looking right at the camera. At me.

I scrambled back, knocking over a glass of water on his nightstand. The sound shattered the
silence, and reality came crashing back in. I fumbled for my own phone, my fingers thick and
clumsy, and dialed 911. The dispatcher's calm, professional voice was an anchor in a swirling
sea of horror. I choked out Mark's address, babbling something about my friend not breathing.
The paramedics arrived first, then the police. Two officers, a man and a woman, separated me
from the paramedics and started asking questions. I told them the truth, or a version of it. I was
his friend. He called me, sounded strange. I came over to check on him. I found him like this.
The male officer, whose name was Miller, picked up Mark's phone. He looked at the screen, his
brow furrowed.

""What is this?"" he asked, showing it to me. The face was still there, frozen on the screen.

""It's an app,"" I said, my voice hoarse. ""A game. A ghost-hunting thing. He was testing it for me.""
Miller grunted, a sound of mild disapproval. He showed it to his partner. She squinted at it.
""Creepy,"" she said, and handed it back. He tapped the screen, but the image was frozen. He
had to hard-reboot the phone to get it to turn off. When it came back on, the image was gone.
Just a normal lock screen with a picture of a nebula. They saw a creepy picture from a game. I
saw a photograph of a murderer.

The official cause of death came the next day. A massive, spontaneous stroke. Sudden Adult
Death Syndrome. They said the look on his face was common in such cases, the result of the
brain's final, catastrophic misfire. The call to his parents was the hardest thing I've ever done. I
listened to his mother's sobs, telling her what the doctors had said, the lies feeling like poison on
my tongue. How do you tell a mother that her son is dead because you accidentally coded a
doorway to hell?

I went home from the police station and locked the door. I didn't turn on any lights. I just sat on
my couch in the dark, the silence of my own apartment feeling loud and threatening. Every
creak of the floorboards, every groan of the building settling, every distant siren was a potential
threat. My carefully constructed world, built on logic and code, had been shattered. I had
opened a door, and I had no idea how to close it.
The first week was a haze of grief and guilt. I didn't touch my computers. The thought of looking
at Aura's code made me physically ill. I was done. The project was over. I wanted to believe that
if I just walked away, it would all stop.

But then the subtle things started happening.
It began subtly. I'd find the pantry door, the one I'd explicitly checked before leaving, nudged open by an inch, its shadow stretching too long across the linoleum. My keys, meticulously hung on the hook by the door, would mysteriously reappear on the coffee table, resting precisely where I'd left them only moments before, yet inexplicably moved. I blamed it on grief, on exhaustion. My mind was playing tricks on me, I told myself.

Then came the cold spots. One evening, an intense, localized chill descended, sharp as a winter breath. It wasn't just a temperature drop; the air itself felt heavy, thick with a metallic tang, and my breath plumed visibly before my face. I gasped, goosebumps erupting across my skin. It felt like standing in front of an open freezer door. I got up, but the frigid pocket followed, clinging to me like a shroud. I walked into the kitchen, and the patch of freezing air moved with me, a pocket of winter in my heated apartment. I even grabbed a digital thermometer. The air in the kitchen was 72 degrees. The air in the cold spot was 45. Then, as abruptly as it arrived, the air warmed, leaving only the ghost of an icicle down my spine.
The shadows were harder to explain. From the corner of my eye, a flicker of movement, a tall, dark shape, would dart past the doorway to the hall. My head would snap around, but there was always nothing there. It left behind only a chilling residue, a sense of something having been there, something that vanished the moment I tried to focus.

The breaking point came about three weeks after Mark's death. I was in the shower, the one
place I felt I could let my guard down. The hot water and steam were a temporary shield against
the creeping dread. I was rinsing the shampoo from my hair when I heard it.

A whisper.

It was faint, almost lost in the hiss of the water, but it was unmistakable. It was that same dry,
scraping voice from the phone call. And it said my name.

""Leo...""

I froze, shampoo suds dripping into my eyes. The water suddenly felt icy cold. My heart
hammered against my ribs. I shut off the faucet, plunging the bathroom into a near-silent state,
the only sound the frantic thumping in my chest and the slow drip-drip-drip from the
showerhead.

""Who's there?"" I called out, my voice a pathetic croak.
Silence.

I stood there for what felt like an eternity, naked and vulnerable, straining my ears. Nothing. Had
I imagined it? Was I finally losing my mind?
No. I knew what I had heard.

It was in my apartment. It had followed me from Mark's. Or worse, it hadn't followed me. It had
just changed its focus. The app was the window. Mark had looked through it, and it had taken
him. Now it was my turn. I was the one who had built the window.

I stumbled out of the shower, grabbing a towel. My mind was racing. I couldn't live like this,
haunted by shadows and whispers, waiting for the final, terrifying confrontation. I had to know. I
had to see it. I had to understand what I was up against.

There was only one way to do that.
My hands were shaking as I walked to my desk and picked up my phone. I hadn't looked at the
app since that night. My thumb hovered over the icon for Aura, a stylized, swirling letter 'A'. Part
of me was screaming not to do it, to just run, to leave everything behind. But another, more
desperate part needed to see. I had to turn the lie I had created into a tool for truth.
I tapped the icon.

The app loaded, the familiar purple and blue interface filling the screen. It looked so innocent.
So harmless. I took a deep breath and stood up, holding the phone like a shield. I activated the
main filter.

I panned the phone across my living room. For a few seconds, nothing happened. The screen
just showed my apartment, tinted with the app's signature ethereal glow. Then, the algorithm
started doing its job. A few fake wisps of smoke appeared near a bookshelf, faded, and then
disappeared. I almost let out a sigh of relief. It was just a stupid app. It was all in my head.
Then I pointed the phone towards the darkest corner of the room, near the hallway entrance
where I'd seen the shadows move.
The phone's screen flickered violently. The gentle, swirling colors of the interface glitched,
dissolving into a mess of green and black pixels for a second, like the app was struggling to
process what it was seeing. My phone grew hot in my hand.

Then the image resolved.

It wasn't a wisp. It wasn't a smoky, vague shape. Standing in the corner of my room was a
figure. It was tall and unnaturally thin, a stark, black silhouette that seemed to absorb the light
around it, making the shadows in the corner look pale by comparison. It was featureless, a void
in the shape of a man, but it had presence. It had weight.

As I watched, frozen in place, it slowly turned its head to look at me. There was no face, no
eyes, but I felt its gaze lock onto me through the phone. A wave of pure, undiluted malevolence
washed over me, a psychic pressure that made my teeth ache and my vision swim.
Then, the audio feed crackled to life. It wasn't the pre-programmed static. It was a low, guttural
growl that vibrated through the phone, a sound of pure hate.

I had built a window. And now, the thing on the other side was looking back.

I didn't scream. I couldn't. The sound was trapped in my throat, choked off by a terror so
profound it felt like a physical weight on my chest. I lowered the phone, my arm trembling
uncontrollably. I looked at the corner with my own eyes. Nothing. Just shadows. But I knew it
was there. I could feel it. The air was thick with its presence, heavy and cold.

I raised the phone again. The black figure was still there, motionless, watching me. I took a
stumbling step back, and its head tilted, a gesture of cold curiosity. The low growl from the
phone's speaker deepened, and underneath it, a voice began to coalesce from the static.

""Leo... the architect...""

The voice was the same dry rasp I'd heard before, but clearer now, stronger. It was using my
app as a megaphone, focusing its energy through the very code I had written.

I dropped the phone. It clattered to the floor, the screen showing the ceiling. I scrambled away,
crab-walking backward until my back hit the opposite wall, my eyes locked on the empty corner.
I could hear the voice still coming from the phone's speaker, a distorted, mocking whisper.
""...opened... the door...""

I spent the rest of the night huddled on my couch, wrapped in a blanket, with every light in the
apartment blazing. Sleep was impossible. Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that featureless
black silhouette, that void in the shape of a man. The entity, my entity, was here. It was real. And
it knew my name.

The next day, I became an investigator in my own horror story. Fueled by a desperate, terrified
energy, I turned to the only thing I knew: the code. If I had created the problem, then somewhere
in the millions of lines of code, there had to be a solution. There had to be an ""off"" switch.
I sat at my computer, forcing myself to open the Aura project files. Looking at the familiar
interface of my coding environment felt profane. This workspace, which had once been my
sanctuary, now felt like a crime scene. I pulled up the core files for the pareidolia filter and the
audio engine.

I had been so proud of its design. It was supposed to work by taking random input and forcing a
pattern onto it. But what if it wasn't forcing a pattern? What if it was detecting one? What if the
""random"" energy fluctuations it was reading weren't random at all?

I dove into the audio-processing module first, since that was the source of the voice. I had built
a sophisticated noise generator that was seeded by the microphone's raw input. It was meant to
capture ambient sound, strip out recognizable frequencies, and use the remaining ""junk"" data to
create its EVP effect. My terrifying hypothesis was that the entity was somehow embedding its
voice into that junk data.

For hours, I analyzed the code, running simulations, checking data flows. And then I found it. A
single, elegant, and catastrophic flaw. In my attempt to create a more ""natural-sounding"" static, I
had created a recursive feedback loop. The app wasn't just listening to ambient noise; it was
listening to the static it was producing, processing it, and then feeding it back into the system. It
was a closed loop, designed to refine the randomness. Instead, it had turned my app into a kind
of sonic focusing lens. It was amplifying a frequency I couldn't hear, a carrier wave in the noise,
making it stronger and stronger until it became a bridge. The entity wasn't just speaking into the
microphone; it was using the feedback loop to power its own manifestation, to pull itself into our
world.

The realization hit me like a physical blow. I hadn't built a fake ghost detector. I had built a real
ghost amplifier.

A sudden, sharp CRACK from the kitchen made me jump out of my chair. My heart leaped into
my throat. I crept out of my office, my every nerve screaming. On the kitchen floor, in a thousand
pieces, was a ceramic mug that had been sitting on the counter, a good two feet from the edge.
""Clever boy,"" the voice whispered. This time, it wasn't from the phone. It was in the room with
me, a faint, sibilant hiss that seemed to come from everywhere at once. ""You understand the logic, Leo. Now feel the consequence.""

I ran back to my desk, my hands shaking. The haunting was escalating. The subtle events were
giving way to overt, physical displays. It was getting stronger. And my app was its battery pack.
Over the next few days, my life became a living hell. The entity grew bolder. It was a constant,
oppressive presence. I would be working, and a book would fly off a shelf behind me. The lights
would flicker and die, plunging me into darkness, only to flare back on moments later. The
whispers were no longer just whispers; they were taunts.

I used the app sparingly, only when I absolutely had to know where it was. Each time, the image
of the black silhouette became slightly more defined. I started to see hints of a shape within the
void, something emaciated and twisted. The growls and whispers from the audio feed grew in
clarity.

""Mark... screamed for you,"" it hissed at me one night, the voice coming from my phone's
speaker as I watched the silhouette stand motionless by my bedroom door. ""He knew you left
him.""

""Shut up,"" I whispered back to the empty room, tears of rage and terror streaming down my
face.

""You built the door,"" it continued, its voice a venomous caress. ""Now you must pay the toll. All
who build the doors must pay.""

It was feeding on me. On my fear, my guilt, my focus. The more I interacted with it, the more I
researched the code, the more I thought about it, the stronger it became. My attempt to
understand my prison was only reinforcing the bars.
I tried to find answers outside of my own code. I spent sleepless nights trawling the darkest
corners of the internet,paranormal forums, occult wikis, digitized versions of crumbling old
grimoires. I learned about resonant frequencies, about entities drawn to focused human will,
about the idea of digital sigils. The consensus, from madmen and scholars alike, was terrifyingly
consistent: to create a connection, you need a symbol and you need energy. I had created a
digital symbol,the app itself,and a machine that generated its own energy. I had, in my blind
arrogance, stumbled upon the recipe for summoning a demon and had written it in Python.
I even found a ghost of a story on an obscure developer forum from six years prior. A user with
a now-deleted account posted a frantic message about an ""unintended audio feedback
phenomenon"" in an AR project he was working on. He described hearing voices in the static,
voices that knew his name. The few replies dismissed him as a crank or a troll. Three days after
his initial post, his account went silent. He never logged in again. Reading it felt like finding my
own tombstone, already carved.

The entity started using Mark against me. One afternoon, I heard the faint sound of music
coming from my living room. It was a deep cut from an obscure indie band that Mark and I had
seen live years ago. Our song, we used to joke. It was coming from my speakers, which were
unplugged. The taunts became more specific, laced with details of my past that only Mark could
have known. It was proof that it hadn't just killed him; it had violated him, perhaps even absorbed fragments of his being. It had his memories.
The breaking point, the moment I knew I had to act, came on a Tuesday night. I had been
awake for nearly forty-eight hours, staring at code, trying to find a way to reverse the feedback
loop. I must have drifted off at my desk. I was jolted awake by the sound of my bedroom door
slamming shut with enough force to shake the wall.
I grabbed my phone and activated Aura. I pointed it down the hall. The black figure wasn't
standing in the corner anymore. It was moving. It was slowly, deliberately gliding down the
hallway, directly towards my office. And it wasn't just a silhouette. The filter was now resolving a
horrifying form within the blackness. Long, spindly limbs that moved with a jerky, unnatural gait.
A skeletal frame draped in what looked like rags of shadow. And the face,the face from Mark's
phone,was now visible, a snarling mask of ancient evil.


The audio wasn't a whisper anymore. It was a clear, cold, conversational voice.

""Time is up, Leo. I'm tired of the waiting room.""

I could hear it with my own ears now, a faint echo of the voice from the phone. The barrier was
breaking down. Soon I wouldn't need the app to see it or hear it. It was manifesting.

That was it. I couldn't fight it. I couldn't contain it. My only option was to destroy the connection.
To burn the bridge.

The entity was at the doorway to my office now. Through the phone, it was a towering, horrifying
monster. With my own eyes, it was a shimmering distortion in the air, a place where the light
seemed to bend and warp around a point of absolute cold. A glass on my desk rattled, then slid
to the edge and shattered on the floor.

My mind raced, formulating a desperate plan. The code, the app, the servers,they were the
anchor. The digital footprint was the doorway. I had to erase every last trace of it.

I sat down at my keyboard, my fingers flying. The entity was in the room with me now. The cold
was intense, biting. My breath plumed in front of my face. Through the phone, which I had
propped up on the desk, I could see it looming over me, its featureless face inches from mine.
""You built this cage, architect. You are bound to it,"" it hissed, the sound both in my ears and in my head.
A wave of pressure slammed into me. The air grew thick, like I was moving through water. My
vision swam. The entity on the screen let out a shriek, a sound of digital feedback and tearing
metal.

I started with the remote repository, the master source of the code stored in the cloud. I opened my terminal, fingers flying, and typed git push --delete origin master. The command, to erase the primary branch, executed.

A wave of pressure slammed into me. The air grew thick, like I was moving through water. My
vision swam. The entity on the screen let out a shriek, a sound of digital feedback and tearing
metal.

Next, the backups. I had them stored on a separate cloud server. I logged in, my fingers
fumbling on the keys. The lights in my office flickered violently. My monitor buzzed, the text
blurring.

""THE DOOR..."" the entity roared, the voice seeming to shake the very foundations of the
building.

I felt an icy, crushing grip on my shoulder. It was real. Not just a feeling of cold, but the distinct,
sharp pressure of phantom fingers digging into my muscle. I cried out in pain, arching my back,
but I didn't stop typing. I navigated to the directory and initiated the delete command. rm -rf /aura_backups.

The grip vanished, but the cold intensified. The monitor went black.

""NO!""

I didn't panic. I knew the keyboard shortcuts by heart. I kept typing blind, confirming the deletion.
I hit Enter. The monitor flickered back on, showing a confirmation message. The backup files
were gone.

Only my local files remained. Two drives. A primary solid-state drive and a secondary hard drive
for storage. I opened the file explorer. The entity was raging now. The distortion in the air was
churning, violent. The papers on my desk swirled into the air as if caught in a whirlwind. A
framed picture of me and Mark flew off the wall and shattered against the door.

""YOU CANNOT CLOSE WHAT YOU HAVE OPENED!""
I selected the Aura project folder on my main drive. My hand hovered over the delete key. I
could feel its focus on me, a pressure on my mind that was trying to break my will. I saw an
image of Mark's face in my mind, his eyes wide with terror.

I slammed the delete key. Are you sure you want to permanently delete these files?

""YES!!""

A piercing shriek filled the room, a sound of pure agony that was both physical and psychic. It
threw me back from my desk, my chair skidding across the floor. On my phone, the entity's form
was dissolving, unraveling like a corrupted video file, its pixels shredding into nothingness.

I crawled back to the desk, ignoring the pain in my head. One drive left. The secondary storage.
I selected the final directory. My final sin.
Just as my finger touched the key, I felt it. Icy, unseen hands closing around my throat. The
pressure was immense, cutting off my air. My lungs burned. Black spots danced in my vision.
This was it. This was how it ended. Just like Mark.
With the last of my strength, my vision tunneling to a single point, I lunged forward and hit the
Enter key with the palm of my hand.

The pressure vanished.

The screaming stopped.

The whirlwind in the room died.

The distortion in the air dissipated.

The figure on my phone screen dissolved into a final shower of static, and then the app crashed,
returning the screen to my normal home page.
Everything was silent. Utterly, completely silent. I lay on the floor, gasping for air, my throat raw.
The cold in the room slowly receded, replaced by the normal, ambient temperature. I sat up, my
body trembling with adrenaline and exhaustion.
It was over. I had done it. I had closed the door.
For a long time, I just sat there on the floor of my ruined office, surrounded by broken glass and
scattered papers, and I cried. I cried for Mark. I cried out of sheer, gut-wrenching terror. And I
cried with a sliver of relief so profound it was painful.
Eventually, I got up. I packed a bag. I walked out of my apartment without looking back. The
next day, I went to my garage, took the hard drives from my computer, and drilled holes through
them until they were nothing but shattered platters and ruined electronics. I drove for two days,
putting as much distance between me and that place as I could.

Which brings me to now. Three months later. I live in a small, anonymous apartment in a city
where no one knows my name. The whispers are gone. The shadows are gone. The cold spots
are gone. The entity I gave form to is gone, its anchor to this world destroyed.

But I am not free.

I have a new fear now. A quieter, more insidious one. Before, when the haunting was at its
peak, I had the app. I had my terrible lens. I could turn it on and see my tormentor. I knew where
it was. I could see the monster in the corner, the demon in the hallway. I could face my enemy.
Now, I am blind.

I sit in the dark of my new apartment, and the silence is the loudest thing I've ever heard. Every
creak of the floorboards in the apartment above, every gust of wind against the windowpane,
every unfamiliar groan of a new building settling sends a jolt of pure ice through my veins. Last
week, a floorboard in my own hallway creaked when I was sitting perfectly still in the living room.
I spent the next six hours sitting on a kitchen stool with my back against the wall, watching the
hallway, until the sun came up. It was probably just the building's old wood contracting.
Probably.

I destroyed the door I built. I have to believe that. But what if it didn't need the door anymore?
What if all my app did was teach it how to notice us? What if it's just weaker now, biding its
time?

I have no way of knowing. I have no way of checking. I have removed my only sense that could
perceive the world I now know for a fact is real. The terror of seeing the monster is nothing
compared to the terror of knowing it's there, and not being able to see it at all. It could be
standing in the corner of this room right now, watching me type these words, a silent, gaunt
spectator to my confession. And it could be smiling, remembering the taste of my friend's fear.
I don't know. And I will never know again. That is my true haunting.

So please. If you are a programmer, a creator, a dreamer, and you have an idea like the one I
had,leave it alone. Don't build the door. Don't even draw the blueprints. Some things in the
dark are meant to stay there, unseen. Because once you see them, they see you too. And even
if you manage to close your eyes, you'll never be able to forget that they're still there, watching.",DougandLexi,Reddit,Neutral,-0.01704634272890852
2017-12-16 10:28:26,"The Five Fleets are a symbol for the five generations of hunters who all picked up the game at different times. I'm not sure if anyone's noticed this before, but the more lore I hear about the Fleets, the more they sound like a general history of Monster Hunter itself. I might be pulling this all out of my ass, but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense.

From what we know, the First Fleet of Monster Hunter World consists of the first pioneers to the new continent. The first generation of hunters consists of the hunters who first started the game with the original Monster Hunter. Like the first fleet, these hunters are the toughest of tough. The pioneers who, through persistence and sheer force of will, powered through Monster Hunter at its worst. The ""First Fleet"" of hunters consists of those who had to battle through unbalanced weapons, unclear tutorials, and Plesioth hip checks.

The Second Fleet of Monster Hunter World consists of the technicians. These are the blacksmiths, the engineers, and the craftsmen. This fleet of technicians came to the new world in to throw away the old conventions and create something new for themselves. Likewise, the second generation of hunters brought with them the most changes to the game. Weapons were given offshoots (Dual Blades from SnS, Gunlance from Lance, Longsword from Greatsword, etc) techniques were solidified (we all remember having to claw the PSP), and weaker weapons were given new life and brought up to par (SnS was no longer dead weight and found its strength in status and elemental damage). This is also the time I first remember [Romance Hunting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHSOgeZpVe8) becoming a thing, where the goal was less about killing a monster and more about looking cool while doing it.

The Third Fleet of Monster Hunter World consists of researchers who came to study the new world; all the scholars and thinkers bringing their knowledge to help the new world. This generation of hunters brought with it a more flourishing internet community for MonHun. Like the Third Fleet researchers who brought their knowledge, the third Generation of hunters brought with them new weapon tutorials (I remember this is when SocialDissonance got me to stop using the Longsword and try out all the other weapons), a more updated wiki (goodbye, GameFAQs!), and a healthy streaming community. This is also the time of the first iteration of [Kiranico](http://kiranico.com/) for MH3U, which aided greatly in looking for drops.. In addition, the games always show a little tension between the scholarly groups and the hunters, similar to the tension between this generation of hunters (Nintendo era) and the one preceding it (PSP era). Of course, this is all just a friendly rivalry, as both groups know they need each other and are all the better for it when they're together.

The Fourth Fleet of Monster Hunter World consisted of new hunters and scouts, a welcome sight for those in the new world. Monster Hunter 4 was marketed the most user friendly Monster Hunter to date, the franchise's attempt to expand its playerbase. With most of the barriers to entry removed, the fourth generation was, in my experience, the one that hooked a majority of my friends in. And, just as the Fourth Fleet's new batch of fresh blood brought new tactics and ideas, the Fourth Generation of hunters saw the first iteration of the mounting mechanic, and Monster Hunter Generations, the experimental leap that brought us hunting styles and new ways to play.

Finally, the Fifth Fleet, the fleet the game's hunters will enter the new continent with, are the most unknown of them all. All we know is that the fifth fleet will be the largest of them all, full of the bright eyed generation of new, but excited hunters. These are the most hopeful of the hunters, as this is the fleet that hopes to solve the still unanswered questions of the new world. Like how the Fifth Fleet symbolizes a new, unknown, but exciting future for the new world, the fifth and current generation of hunters is expected to be the largest generation of hunters who have been given as much hype for this game as the rest of us. This is also Capcom's biggest attempt to market Monster Hunter to the West, and doing so will bring what we hope is the largest influx of new hunters to date. However, we know very little about the upcoming generation of hunters, just like how we've been given very little information on the Fifth Fleet. I've seen concerns that this new generation will spoil one of the friendliest communities I've known. But, like the captains of the other fleets to the hunter, it will be our duty, as veterans to the series, to not only bring the new hunters up to speed, but to also ensure that this generation of hunters comes out just as good than those before it.",RenariPryderi,Reddit,Positive,0.14171873372904303

**Memory transcription subject: Dr Bernard MacEwan, Professor of Zoology**

**Date \[Standardised human time\]: 11th September 2136**

One after the other my students took to the podium to present their animal of choice. An array of easily recognisable forms and behaviours contrasted striking departures from my perception of the norm. Regardless of whether they were familiar or exotic however, each was unique and wonderful in their own way!

The Dorben was another specimen from offworld. Hailing from the Dossur homeworld of Mileau, I initially mistook it for a wide flat rock when its picture popped up on the monitor. My misunderstanding was cleared up when it was explained that the herbivorous reptile was almost entirely encased in a stone-like shell, its four legs and head merging into its armoured carapace so seamlessly as to be nearly invisible.

Prior to first contact with the Federation, the Dossur had apparently used the Dorben as a means of transportation; their flat backs, slow yet dependable pace, and lasting endurance provided the perfect perch to ride on over long distances that a Dossur couldn’t have reasonably made on foot. The presenter even remarked that there were rumours that Dossur out in rural communities still maintained the practice, earning a few disbelieving chortles from those who felt that the idea of riding atop an animal was laughable. I decided not to bring up horses at that moment; they’d learn sooner or later with what I had planned anyway.

Next up were Laysi and, well… a lot could be said about the Laysi. Having spent my life around animals of every shape, size, and appearance there was little that could faze me. Even common forms of animal induced fear like arachnophobia and galeophobia weren’t even a blip on my radar. However, this particular black and red arachnid would certainly test my courage if I was to ever see one in the wild.

I must have let a little of my discomfort slip out, as the presenter was quick to insist that the Laysi was an adorable and extremely docile creature. Though that hardly changed the fact that the flying nectarivore remained a dead ringer for two of humanity’s least favourite species melded into one. Its enormous eight legged body bore the hallmark silhouette of a Black Widow, its head equipped with a pair of compound eyes and a long Mosquito-like proboscis.

*And aliens say* ***we*** *look scary. This creepy crawly will have people running for the hills!* 

Still, first impressions aside, they weren’t all bad. Considering their diet it was unsurprising that they were incredibly effective pollinators. Plus, the iridescence of their wings made them rather pretty to look at in the right light. A couple ticks in the win column for the Laysi.

Two of my students had worked together to prepare a shared presentation on a pair of animals that were night and day to one another, literally! Voidpins and Sunspecks were both mouse like rodents with coats that perfectly fit their namesakes, the former's being matte jet black while the latters was a reflective golden blonde. 

Like their outward appearance, both animals had vastly differing temperaments. Voidpins were, as the presenter put it, pernicious household invaders that scurried through the nooks and crannies of cities, towns, and farms, finding refuge in dark hidey-holes and absconding with food from the cupboards and crops of hardworking Venlil.

While their description of the little rodent was saddled with the same negative tone as Vlek’s presentation, it quickly became apparent that they simply had a flair for the dramatic and, unlike Vlek’s exercise in rhetoric, they ended up imparting a few fascinating tidbits about the Voidpin. Namely that they were extremely difficult to catch and that they had a penchant for stealth that he swore rivalled any ambush predator he’d ever heard of. Furthermore there was anecdotal evidence suggesting a shrewdness to the rodents, with a handful of tales circulating the internet detailing how a homeowner or farmer was lured away from food or grain stocks after giving chase to a single Voidpin only to return to their task to see a dozen or so other rodents pilfering their pantries.

The Sunspeck on the other hand was completely different to the intrepid and roguish Voidpin. Far from being domestic pests they instead made their home as far away from civilization as possible. The Burning, a ring of desert between the more habitable regions of Venlil Prime and the aptly named Sun Wastes on the planet's eastern side. 

*Wait… eastern side or eastern pole? Would the Venlil even consider poles and axes the same we would since their planets tidally locked? Maybe they* ***would*** *put more emphasis on the eastern and western geographic regions since those are the points closest to and furthest away from the sun? And that’s not even factoring in magnetic poles.*

*Hmmm… An interesting thing to look up when I’m not busy listening to my students.*

Tucking the fascinating prospect of researching cardinal directions and magnetic poles of an alien planet away for another day, I turned my attention back just in time to learn that Sunspecks formed huge, ant-like burrows under the sun beaten sands and dirt of their home turf, amassing in colonies of up to 200 individuals. [Kangaroo Mice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kangaroo_mouse) immediately came to mind when the Sunspecks picture appeared on screen, though their ears were larger and more dish-shaped. Fascinatingly, their reflective fur was an adaptation that protected them against the harsh elements of The Burning, capable of dissipating heat by redirecting sunlight. They also had a habit of swarming anything that disturbed their burrows, blinding and befuddling their would-be attacker as a hoard of squealing shining rodents ran over, under, and past them to safety.

The Sunspecks discoverer had *discovered* this trait first hand; an experience would not have envied regardless of any accolades it may have awarded me.

Insects were next to the fore following our rodent pair. 

Scourge of libraries the world over, the Evenhopper munched its way through tome after tome of knowledge, classic literature, and anything else still beholden to paper and pen. These grasshopper-like insects were a common pest anywhere such things were stored, becoming the bane of archivists, librarians, and private collectors of the written word. The presenter couldn’t quite remember the name of it, but to the relief of book lovers everywhere there was a plant based repellent specifically tailored to the Evenhopper, helping to stem the tide of the voracious paper munchers.

*I wonder if the Evenhopper is the Venlil’s equivalent to the trope of opening a cupboard or musty box only for moths to fly out after having eaten through everything?* 

*I think I’d take moths to suddenly having a hoard of grasshoppers leaping out at me.*

Blue-Backed Beetles were also presented, bearing a similar appearance to the June Beetle despite being a little bit larger and having a vibrant blue shell that boasted a dazzling metallic sheen. Their brilliant carapace was understandably considered to be their most impressive feature, so much so in fact that a rather famous artist expended considerable effort to replicate it. Bizarrely however, in spite of getting both the colour and metallic shimmer down pat, the artist lamented that their creation was merely a copy.

To quote them, “No matter how perfect a copy it may be, and it ***is*** perfect, it shall forever be a hollow replication. A shadow of this magnificence born of nature. A mockery of the truly ungraspable enormity of the pulchritudinous world upon which we last but for a moment in the great eternity of the cosmos! …It’s just not as good.”

*Wow. And I thought my language edged on the needlessly convoluted at times. That guy just regurgitated a thesaurus!*

With our muse of a Beetle come and gone, next came an animal that, in all honesty, I was sure I’d misheard the name of. To my utter astonishment it turned out I’d heard correctly, and I watched in utter fascination as its image materialised on screen.

The Blurmf.

These semi-aquatic molluscs could be found almost anywhere on the Tilfish homeworld of Sillis, the fertile coastlines of its megacontinent providing an endless feast for the miniscule leaf lovers. At a length of barely a centimetre, the Blurmf was easily missed if you weren’t looking for it, but that wasn’t just due to its size. While its main body was mostly a milky white save for a set of six bluish feelers that stuck out from its face, its back and sides were covered in green frills, allowing it to blend in almost seamlessly with the plants it consumed, which explained how they were only discovered in the last decade.

It turned out that the Blurmf didn’t just gain nutrition from fibrous plant matter, oh no. They were also capable of absorbing the chlorophyll from plants! The frills along its back were suffused with the compound, allowing the Blurmf to not only energise itself from eating in the conventional sense but also through photosynthesis.

[Leaf Sheep!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costasiella_kuroshimae) *I’m looking at alien Leaf Sheep! My God, they're almost identical. An example of convergent evolution perhaps? Astounding!*

As fascinating as they were in those aspects alone however, what really pulled at everyones curiosity was their name.

The Blurmf.

Well apparently that was the result of the Sillis government getting involved with the scientific community. At the time of their discovery a politician thought it’d be a great idea to get the people more interested in their home and the creatures that lived upon it. A noble pursuit I’d be behind 100%, if it weren’t for how they did it.

At the request of this minister, the Tilfish scientists responsible for the Blurmf’s discovery set up polls for citizens to add and vote on possible names for the new species. This went about as well as could be expected when asking the general public for their opinions on naming conventions. While human scientists would have had a good laugh at names like Boaty McBoatFace, Splotchy Tallboi the 3rd, or Definitely Not A Shark (Ok *Maybe* a Shark), they would ultimately not have gone with whatever ludicrous name no doubt took the top spot. However, the need to appear *herd-like* and respect the public's decision ended up twisting the researcher's antenna. And thus the species was christened.

The Blurmf.

*You know what, it works. Good job people of Sillis. 100% Human approved.*

Rova was the next speaker of the day, almost bouncing to the podium in glee as her tail whipped happily behind her. As the first images for her presentation flickered on screen the question of why she seemed so happy was effortlessly buffeted away.

“May I present to you my favourite bird of all time. The Liri of Colia!”

Graceful. There was no other word for it. Every dignified feature of a Swan, Peacock, and Secretary bird rolled into one refined package.

Standing tall with aristocratic poise, the Liri roosted atop a rocky overhang; a shimmering pool of water below reflecting its regal form. Feathers hugged a slender body, flowing all the way down from the top of its head and ending in a set of metre long tail-feathers. The Liri was almost completely white, save for its orange beak, beige legs, and captivating golden eyes that seemed to draw you in the longer you gazed into them.

Truly the Liri was a remarkably beautiful bird, its appearance alone would easily make it a crowd favourite within seconds of its image hitting the internet back home. Considering the blur of eagerness currently flapping its way through Rova’s ears however, I suspected there was even more to this bird than initially met the eye.

“Isn’t it gorgeous? **Ah**! It's so elegant! And if that wasn’t enough there’s an even greater, far more dazzling nature beneath the Liri’s already magnificent surface!”

Despite being in the middle of a presentation Rova could barely take her eyes off of the screen behind her, fumbling with the controls while trying to move onto the next slide. Thanks to her lack of focus she nearly shut down the entire projector setup at one point, pulling a few disapproving brays from audience members who’d become as enamoured with the aesthetically pleasing avian as she was and receiving a alarmed glare from Kailo who’d set the whole thing up in the first place.

Her concentration quickly returned thanks to that little snafu, Rova swiftly loaded up a video of the same Liri perched upon the same rock, breathing deeply to calm herself before pressing play, “Ok, ok… sorry everyone, just taking a moment. This video gets me everytime so I need to prepare. Hew… Ok. I’d tell you what you’re about to see but… well, nothing I could say would adequately compare to seeing and hearing it for yourself. Please enjoy.”

With her cryptic and beguiling suggestion of what was to come Rova hit play and hurriedly darted back to her seat, nearly crashing into it as she rapidly spun around and locked her full attention to the monitor. The giddiness weaving through her tail stood out like a sore thumb, causing my curiosity to rocket ever higher.

*It has to be birdsong right? That would be the most logical assumption. If it is, it must have some voice to make someone* ***that*** *excited.*

There were a couple seconds of silence as the video kicked in, broken by the sound of branches rustling in the breeze as the audio began to filter through the speakers. The ambient chirping of several other birds could be heard though none other than the Liri came into frame. The underside of the rocky overhang it stood upon glittered with light, courtesy of the pool below it reflecting the sun's rays back up into it. 

The serenity was intruded upon only by the occasional droplet of water falling from the overhang into the pool below, casting ripples across its surface and causing the light bouncing off of it to scatter before settling once more into peaceful stillness.

Our expectations continued to grow as the scene played out before us, simultaneously being a paradoxical source of both great anticipation and comforting tranquillity. While hardly any time passed in reality, the gentleness of the video lulled me into such a state of relaxation that it felt as if time was slowing to a crawl; a feeling of stress I didn’t even realise I’d been holding onto being lifted from my shoulders with ease.

*White noise in visual form, how lovely. If this is all the video turns out to be then I’d be quite happy with that.*

Just as soon as the thought had passed through my mind however, the Liri stirred. Beak parted, its chest swelled as it drew in a breath, its torso and neck straightening out while its wings unfolded and spread out to reveal…

*My. God.*

An eruption of colour exploded from beneath the Liri’s outstretched wings, the underside of each and every feather starkly contrasting their snow white surface. Some were composed of a single hue; red, green, purple, and fuchsia being a mere handful of the litany of shades on display. Others looked like they’d taken a stroll through the entirety of the visible light spectrum and taken a souvenir of every part of the rainbow with them in the process. 

The light bouncing off of the water below the Liri struck its feathers as they stretched ever wider, scattering into a wondrous twinkling light show with beams cascading through the air in an impossible dance of enthralling brilliance. A little whisper in the back of my brain told me that what I was seeing was simply due to how the camera was picking up the light as it funnelled into its lens, but that didn’t make it any less gorgeous to look at.

Astonishingly, in spite of this already extraordinary sight, it was what came next that would fully cement the Liri as one of the most spectacular animals I’d ever been lucky enough to see.

Wings raised high in all their glory and with its lungs full to bursting, the Liri began to sing.

A single steady hum flowed from its beak, the opening note of its song carrying a soothing air that washed over the audience. A second note followed, higher in pitch but still maintaining the same gentleness as the first. My eyes bulged in shock as the Liri belted out a third note, a bouncing staccato that fluctuated between the boundaries of the first and second note while keeping a simple regular pace.

*Three notes at once? What the… HOW!? How can it-*

All thought was cut short as the Liri stunned me into a complete mental silence by adding yet another note to its tune, and it was far from done. 

Note after note, it continued to add to its song, the melody growing in complexity and beauty until all in all there were nine distinct tones being sung at once. It was as if an entire string section was housed within the frame of this single bird, the first two notes setting the tone of the piece with the third acting as a conductor to meter out the tempo that the rest would play along to. The remaining six notes worked together to form an elaborate melody, each one rising and falling in tandem at the start of the song before beginning to playfully bounce off of one another.

As the song progressed we all sat statuesque, no one daring to do anything that would threaten to interrupt the enveloping beauty of the song sweeping through the room. Despite this however, a number of gasps did slip out at a point when the Liri’s voice climbed to such an operatic height that I feared the monitors glass might crack from the pitch alone.

Minor scare aside, the rest of the song was far more tranquil, causing memories to flash through my mind of times I’d spent sat beside the river not too far from my childhood home. Our house had been far enough away from the nearest road so the blare of traffic was never a concern. Only nature, pure and unfiltered. 

Gentle breezes shook the leaf- filled branches of overarching trees, carrying with them the fresh scent of blossoming flowers in the springtime and filling my nostrils with the hearty smell of petrichor in the damper times of the year; which being Scotland meant most times. The occasional plop of fish breaking the surface of the river combined with the buzzing of insects and intermittent bird calls breathed a soul into the world. Warmth radiated from the sun on clear days, a life giving beacon suspended high upon the blue sky. And as evening drew close on those same clear days, the twinkling lights of countless stars millions upon millions of miles away painted a wondrous tapestry across the inky blackness of night.

*Peace. That’s what this song is. Harmonious peace.*   

Leaning back in my chair I sank into the serenity, thinking of nothing but those fond moments from a time long past. 

It was difficult to tell how long passed, maybe ten to fifteen minutes if I had to guess, but sadly all things must come to an end eventually. As the final chirps of the Liri’s song played through the speakers our avian orchestra took flight, looping around the pool several times before making its exit as the video drew to close.

A bittersweet stillness hung over the room. I spied more than a few misty eyed faces in the crowd, moved by the sweet aria of the songbird while being equally saddened by its departure. Others were lounging back in their chairs with closed eyes as I had been, their ears and tails lazily swaying in peaceful contentment. I noticed that some, Rysel being one of them, had the opposite idea and ended up hastily retrieving their pads as the video ended, already searching for more content of the Liri with a fire in their eyes. It took some effort to restrain myself from joining them in the endeavour. I was already chomping at the bit to see more of the Liri in action, but we were still mid-presentation so my wishes would have to wait; though I would certainly be taking the time to look the Liri up in full the moment I was free for the day.

Paws over her own heart and a delighted twirl making its way through her tail, Rova skipped back to the podium with a whistling giggle, “Heehee! So, what do you all think?”

Questions immediately surged forth, clambering over one another and getting lost in the cacophony as everyone tried to sate their curiosity all at once. Far from being overwhelmed by the reaction, Rova looked pleased as punch, ears fluttering in satisfaction at the response her presentation had garnered; a feeling she definitely deserved.

Still, barely restrained chaos wasn’t ideal so I quickly tried to return some semblance of order to the class, “Okay everyone, okay. Settle down. I’m just as curious as you are but we’ll get nowhere fast if Rova can’t make out what any of you are saying.”

My deeper timbre managed to cut through the din of two dozen Venlil well enough to catch their attention, snapping them all out of their momentary hysteria long enough for them to settle down. Satisfied that everything was calm I motioned to Rova to continue.

She bobbed an ear in acknowledgment but I swore I saw disappointment flick through along with it, perhaps pouting over the fact she could no longer revel in the clamour of everyone else's wonder, “Thank you Doctor. I couldn’t make out what most of you were saying but I got the gist of what a lot of you were asking. How? How can the Liri do what it does? Well it’s quite simple really. First off let’s look at its feathers, specifically the undersides of them.”

With a click of the podium a picture of the Liri’s vibrant plumage appeared on screen, several notations in Venlang accompanying them.

“Sorry Doctor, I got so caught up in getting everything ready I forgot about the translations. I’ll read through it all for you though,” Rova swayed her tail apologetically, pointing to the notes, “Like many of the animals we’ve seen this paw, the Liri’s feathers are iridescent. This isn’t incredibly uncommon but the Liri’s situation is quite bizarre. Analysis of moulted feathers indicates that the underside of the feather has a crystalline structure, whereas the surface is more in line with what you would normally imagine when you think of feathers; soft and light, that kind of thing. Strangely enough, its underside has more in common with a geode than organic matter.”

*Yet more startling impossibilities with this bird. How is that possible?*

“Scientists don’t know how this is possible unfortunately.”

*Well that sinks that ship.*

Fresh though it was, my disappointment was somewhat allayed as Rova continued her explanation.

“The Liri is a rather rare bird so studies of it are difficult. Adding to the troubles of proper research is the fact that it lives in the remote mountainous woodlands of Colia, which doesn’t make it easy for anyone to find, even with high tech gear and plenty of resources.”

*Ah I see. Rare and in a challenging environment to get to. It’s unfortunate but understandable why they haven’t been able to conduct proper studies.*

I recalled plenty of occasions in which I or a peer had been waylaid in our research due to everything from poor environmental conditions and faulty equipment all the way to lack of funding and even one instance where an research trip was cancelled last minute because someone far enough up the chain of decision making simply didn’t want to go! 

A pang of sympathy ached in my chest for the unfortunate scholar that had set out to learn about the Liri only to be stymied by things out of their control.

Rova seemed to feel the same way for her expression mirrored how I felt but she perked up as she moved on from the feathers to a still image of the Liri mid-song, “What we do know though is how the Liri can produce such amazing music! You see, birds have an organ called the [syrinx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrinx_(bird_anatomy)). It’s an organ very similar to the larynx that most other species have, also known as the voice-box. Unlike the larynx however, the syrinx sits lower in the trachea at the point where it forks into the lungs. The Liri differs even further from the majority however by having an incredibly unique syrinx. Where all birds can make some noise and some are capable of making two toned songs, the Liri, as you heard, can sing nine notes at once thanks to its incredibly complex syrinx.”

Another image popped up on screen, this time showing a *standard* syrinx compared against the Liri’s. To call it labyrinthine would be a gross understatement. This Gordian Knot of cartilage lodged inside the animal's throat stood polar opposite to the refined stature its surface appearance radiated. I knew from my own studies that birds, on Earth at any rate, had a [respiratory system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_c_ytNDAXQ) that facilitated one-way directional air flow, allowing many species of bird the ability to both inhale and exhale at the same time.

With this in mind I thought back to the video and realised that I’d never actually seen the Liri take a breath throughout the entirety of its song, a song that lasted well over ten minutes. That meant that, **somehow**, the Liri must be capable of the same feat as other birds. How it managed to do this through the tangle of christmas lights that was its vocal organ completely escaped me however.

*Goodness me! I’d love to get my hands on one to try and figure it out. Though I best not say that so flippantly considering my company.*

That thought did bring up the question of how researchers had been able to learn this about the Liri given Rova had already told us how difficult it was to find them. As it turned out, Rova was one step ahead of me.

“Now I imagine some of you are curious as to how this was found out because of what I said earlier. Well it was through somewhat controversial means,” Rova switched the slides to show a Zurulian in a lab coat holding up a 3D model of a Liri, “This is Doctor Polm, a researcher who has dedicated his life to trying to learn about the Liri. He’s still active but he did get in a bit of trouble over a particular decision he made rotations ago. Long story short, he was out on an expedition and found the body of a Liri. One that had been killed by a predator.”

Gasps and chuffs of disgust filled the room, ears pinning back and tails beating off the floor in matching distress. Whether their feelings were directed at the predator for existing or whether they were just venting woe over such a marvellous animal dying I couldn’t say, though I hoped it was the latter.

“As we all know, in a situation like this we should alert the Exterminators and let them handle it. Dr Polm did that… eventually. Before he did raise the alarm however, he took it upon himself to… dissect the Liri to learn more about it. But it’s not like he-”

Whatever defence Rova had been planning to mount on behalf of Dr Polm was immediately bowled over by horrified bleats and repulsed brays from several members of the audience. I for one was left completely bemused by the response. Sure, discomfort over such things was commonplace but this was something else entirely. 

Were they repulsed by the idea of dissection as a concept? Surely not. Regardless of the way they might present themselves or what they might *like* to think about their society, such a thing couldn’t be avoided if you wanted to learn about another species; or even their own species if you were to broaden things out to the larger medical field.

Fortunately I wasn’t forced to ask, as several *aggrieved* students took it upon themselves to indirectly clear things up for me. Not that that ended up being much better.

“Seriously!? **Ugh!** Why would he do that and risk getting tainted?”

“Exactly! It’s bad enough when Exterminators cart in animals that they think died of natural causes and need me to autopsy them to verify it, but to do it on an animal that was clearly killed? **That’s madness!**”

“Was he tested for Predator Disease afterwards? I’d hope so. That’s hardly ***normal*** behaviour.”

*Okay, now we’re bridging across the wrong gap.*

Before I could make a move to quell the rising tide of indignation, Sandi stood with a stern glint in her eye and tail lashing furiously, “**Hey!** Cut it out all of you! Rova was in the middle of speaking and you all interrupted her.”

The scolding caused the guilty parties to shrink in on themselves, all of them having the sense to hurriedly wave an ear apologetically at Rova all while under Sandi’s piercing gaze.

Satisfied that the rabble rousers had settled down Sandi turned to Rova, who’d had her ears pinned back in discomfort while under the angst barrage of the now pacified bellyachers, “Sorry about that. Please, feel free to continue.”

As Sandi retook her seat Rova’s confidence returned, a re-energised sway passing along her tail, “Thank you Sandi. Where was I… Oh yes! So, while it might be true that Dr Polm made a questionable choice, he only did it to advance our understanding of the Liri. I’m not saying I agree with what he did but I can certainly understand it. Imagine trying to learn about a single subject your entire life but it remains forever elusive. Then, suddenly, the chance to study it falls into your lap. I can empathise with what must have gone through his head at the time and I for one appreciate the risk he took for the sake of helping everyone understand this magnificent creature.”

With that Rova closed down her presentation, a final image of the Liri with its wings spread wide materialising on screen before fading into blackness.

Applauding her as she left the podium I happened to catch the time in the corner of my eye and stood from my chair, grinning broadly at the class, “Well said Rova, very well said! The quest for knowledge is fraught with ethical dilemmas, but in my opinion I feel Dr Polm made the right call. He sounds like a person I’d very much like to meet.”

Rova’s tail flicked happily, “Really? I’m sure you could! Like I mentioned earlier he is still active. This incident did hurt his standing a little but he’s still quite a big name in ecological circles. He wouldn’t be too hard to find I imagine.”

“Wonderful!” I replied, stowing away that info for a later date, “Now then, as much as I am looking forward to hearing the rest of your presentations, I couldn’t help but notice it’s time for our lunch break. So, let’s all take the time to get rested and refreshed!”

The class were more than happy to agree with me on the need for a break, the mass of wool pulling me along with them as we made our way out of class in the direction of the canteen.

*So many astonishing animals. And the Liri?* ***WOW!***

2025-05-22 08:05:02,"My SUSS Journey of 4 Years 
Note: This post might be a bit long, but it’s my personal academic journey, and I genuinely hope it inspires fellow students and prospective students, know what to expect and what tips you can learn from my experience.

In 2021, I was on the job hunt. I stumbled upon an opening that required a bachelor's degree, even though my highest qualification was a polytechnic diploma. 

Still, I sent in my CV, just to try my luck. The job recruiter called me and, despite having my CV, asked about my highest qualification. The moment they heard I didn’t have a bachelor's, they abruptly hung up, stating they were only looking for degree holders and above.

That call was a profound wake-up moment for me. It starkly revealed how many potential job opportunities I was missing, and I started seeing more and more listings with degree requirements.

So, after an 8-year hiatus from studying, I decided to enroll in SUSS. Their part-time degrees and evening classes made it possible to attend after work. 

I started part-time Bsc Marketing with a friend, but she dropped out in Y1S1, finding the work-school juggle too tiring. Her leaving was disheartening, but I pushed on, determined not to waste the money I'd already spent on Y1S1’s modules.

During Y1S1, the struggle was real. Juggling work and studies was exhausting. I was completely unaccustomed to doing assignments after work, burning weekends on group meetings, tackling assignments, and studying for exams. I also had to learn proper APA referencing and academic writing from scratch.

My first exam period was mentally and physically torturing. A close friend passed away, and concurrently, I was battling food poisoning – vomiting, high fever, and non-stop diarrhea. 

Yet, giving up was not an option; I was resolute in scoring well. Despite the grief and intense physical challenges, I produced a CGPA of 4.07 in Y1S1.

My polytechnic CGPA of 2.6x/4 wasn’t good enough for a SUSS scholarship. But that Y1S1 CGPA changed everything; it qualified me. After being awarded the SUSS scholarship in Y1S2, I took a major leap: I quit my full-time job to fully focus on my studies.

However, my CGPA subsequently plummeted from 4.07 to 3.93 in Y1S2 because of a C+ in ACC202. I chose not to use my P/F option, being only in Year 1 and unsure if future subjects would be harder. I wanted to retain my P/F options as a backup. 

This is something I regret greatly, as my final CGPA could have been 4.5 and above since my average grades for all other semesters were between A+ to B+. I truly hope those in a similar situation won't make the same mistake.

My final year, Year 4, proved to be the toughest journey. I seriously contemplated quitting; I'd lost motivation due to overwhelming personal events. 

I found myself crying while working on ongoing assignments and studying for my final exam. I received the devastating news that my grandmother passed away while I was in the hospital attending an online lesson for my module, waiting for my turn to visit her (there was a cap on visitors). 

In addition, my mother was diagnosed with cancer, and my dad suffered an accident that badly injured his brain, leaving him permanently mentally incapacitated.


Despite all these profound challenges, I constantly reminded myself why I had signed up for this course in the first place. I continued to push myself to study, eventually finishing my studies with a CGPA of 4.32 this semester. I will proudly be attending the convocation ceremony this year.


I share my story to encourage fellow SUSS students: Do not give up your studies halfway. There will be times you feel unmotivated or question why you’re even pursuing this degree, but please, stay on track to complete the finishing line.

Key Takeaways from My Academic Journey: 
-Consistently Doing Well and Building Rapport
Assignments and Exam Structure

Organise your points for markers and professors to make their job easier; this will likely result in a higher mark as your thought process is easy to follow.

For example, if asked, “What is the benefit of following a customer journey map in marketing?”

A. Start with an introduction statement: 

A customer journey map is a visual representation of the steps a customer takes when interacting with a brand or company, from initial awareness to post-purchase. The following key benefits of a customer journey are as follows:

B. Elaborate your topic:

Benefits of Using Customer Journey Maps:

Improved Customer Experience: By understanding the customer's perspective, businesses can identify areas for improvement and optimize the customer journey to encourage customers to return due to their positive experiences, which could potentially boost a business’s sales from returning customers’ sales.

C. Conclude and summarise: 

Hence, it is important to follow customer journey maps in marketing to improve customer experience to maintain a business’s long-term sustainable profitability.

- Participate in Classes and Actively Email Professors

If you're planning to pursue a master’s degree, some universities require letters of recommendation from academic professors. 

By actively participating in class or building a rapport with your professors, the possibility of them agreeing to be your academic referee is high, and they will be more aware of what to write in your recommendation. 

So far, all the professors I've asked have agreed to be my academic referees and remembered me because I always actively participated in classes and emailed them whenever I had queries.

- Don’t Procrastinate Doing Your Assignments and Studying for Exams

Start doing your assignment the moment it’s released, not at the last minute. Some professors may take days to reply to emails. 

Starting early allows you to email your Professor for clarification on assignment questions, helping you score well. 

Don’t wait until 3-4 days before the due date, as you risk misunderstanding the question, answering incorrectly, or submitting low-quality answers with insufficient research due to last-minute work, leading to an undesired grade.

- Be Proactive in Finding Information

My classmate missed her eCr window period because she forgot to check the deadline, which resulted in her missing one semester and delaying her graduation. Always check at least once a week on the SUSS student portal under “Important Deadlines” and “News and Notices.”

- Work Smart, Not Work Hard

Research: I recommend subscribing to ChatGPT Premium if possible. Under “Explore GPTs,” you can use “Scholar GPT” for efficient research to back up claims in your assignments.

APA Referencing Formatting: If you're unsure of the latest APA referencing formats, use these websites:

https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/apa_style/apa_formatting_and_style_guide/general_format.html

https://apastyle.apa.org/

- Hit all the marking rubric criteria in your assignments: 

Think about how to link your answer to the assignment question to achieve the highest marks under the marking rubrics in the assignment (TMA/GBA/ECA) for 75 marks and above.


If you’re unsure what an assignment question is asking, copy and paste the question into ChatGPT and prompt it to explain in layman terms to you.

- One Month Before Your Exams Start

Gauge how heavy each module is and allocate sufficient time to study for each subject by drawing up a study plan.

- Lastly, and Most Importantly:

Never give up, and always maintain a positive mindset about studying. Keep yourself healthy; take care of your mind and body by exercising and adhering to a healthy diet to boost your brain power and energy. 

This is how you can survive by studying one semester after another.

Lastly, congratulations to all fellow SUSS students attending this year’s convocation ceremony; you have done well! To the rest who are still studying, it will eventually be your turn!

2023-03-16 00:55:58,"NOP Fanfic: An Introduction to Terran Zoology – Prologue Credit to u/SpacePaladin15 for the wonderful story and world they’ve created.

Writing fanfic is a first for me but I’ve just gotten so roped into the stories I’ve read that I wanted to give it a go with an idea I’ve thought about for a while. It’s also my first ever post to reddit so please let me know if I’ve messed up the post in any way.

Not sure if it’s been done before, there is a lot… lot of fanfic on this subreddit, but here is my take on what happens when a group of scholarly Venlil get their first lesson on the biodiversity of Earth.

No idea what an alien version of native zoology would be called so just went with very broad strokes titles. Same goes for anything mentioned about animals. I did enough research to make generalisations for animals mentioned but not much else. Hope any readers enjoy.

**Memory transcription subject: Rysel, Venlil Environmental Researcher**

*Date \[standardised human time\]: 21st August, 2136*

A loud clanking, followed by the hiss of a pressurising airlock, woke me from my peaceful slumber. After taking a moment to adjust to the shuttles bright interior lights I searched around for my shoulder pack. Finding it tucked neatly under my chair I picked it up, looking inside to ensure nothing had fallen out during the flight from Venlil Prime. Taking out and activating my pad, I brought up the message that had led me here.

\-----

*“Greetings Rysel, on behalf of the Venlil Republic please find enclosed an invitation to take part in the Human-Venlil exchange program in your capacity as an Environmental Researcher.*

*As part of efforts to acclimate our people to Humanity, several initiatives have been set up to share knowledge of each other’s history, science, culture and much more. Given your profession and qualifications, you have been identified as a prime candidate for the Introduction to Terran Zoology programme. Like the title suggests, this course has been designed to provide a basic overview of non-sapient animal life on Earth. The aim is to gauge how well, if at all, information on the native fauna of Earth can be spread to the populace at large.*

*Due to the presence of predatory life on Earth, Humans notwithstanding, the course has had few voluntary applications which is why you have been sent this invitation. It is still voluntary, however in addition to the monetary compensation offered on the advertisement for voluntary applications, you will also receive compensation for any lost salary from missed work and a 10% one off payment based on your current salary.*

*This offer will expire in one paw. Should you accept you will be provided a date, time and location for the exchange at a later date.”*

Reading the invitation had thrown me into a flurry of emotions, three standing out from the herd. Fear at the prospect of being near a human, their piercing eyes burrowing into me as they no doubt held themselves back from leaping at me with their sharpened fangs under the guise of this “lesson”. Humour from the idea that a predatory race could grasp a concept as intricate as environmental sciences, much less whatever this zoology is, which my translator notified me was \[the scientific study of the behaviour, structure, physiology, classification, and distribution of animals\]. A fancy word for predators stalking their prey no doubt.

Finally, a little bit of greed. The compensation offer was tempting indeed. Aside from my rather humble salary, research grants had dried up since I hadn’t been fortunate enough to get a survey assignment for potential colonies, and with the embargo on travel that wasn’t likely to be a thing again for quite some time. Venlil Prime had little need for my work on a paw to paw basis, we’d long since surveyed our worlds flora and fauna. Plus, any work I could get would likely just be identifying the remains of whatever the exterminators had dealt with. That, or checking soil quality for the thousandth time for any farmer who couldn’t be bothered to do it themselves.

Nearly the full paw after receiving the offer, swung back and forth by a vortex of conflicting emotions, I accepted the invitation. Immediately I felt a pang of regret. What was I doing!? I’m going to have to be in the room with a spehing predator!!! I have to cancel, I have… a ping from my pad had stopped me mid panic. A notification from my funding account had come through. As quickly as it had come on, my panic had abated as I beheld the figure in my account. Well… the humans can’t be that bad, right?

\-----

And now, here I was. In orbit, about to step onto a space station full of predators so that I could learn about other non-sapient predators. I was not alone in my apprehension; other passengers were clearly stricken with fear at what lay before them. One snowy white Venlil sobbed with their tail wrapped around them for comfort, scanning about as if there were an alternative exit to our transport.

A hissing brought my attention forward, the shuttle doors opening to allow passage. With a deep, trembling breath, I strode forward. Alright humans, lets see what a predators understanding of the environment amounts to.",Still_Performance_39,Reddit,Neutral,0.05389150943396227
2024-08-07 19:47:14,"Yes, Homosexual Acts are Sinful: A Thorough Look # INTRO

**EDIT:** I have been editing this post periodically to make it easier to read and digest. I hope you will find that helpful.

At least 10+ times a day people ask on r/Christianity  ""are homosexual acts sinful?"" or some variation of that. These posts ALWAYS get the most comments out of any other post in this sub reddit, often times by non-Christians that seek to put their morality onto Christians. So I wanted to post this and cover the gambit of arguments people make for and against homosexual acts. Part of the reason is that I hope this post can be used by Christians to respond to those who continually ask (because I also noticed that many responses from Christians are lacking **severely** in theological knowledge or understanding).

I am bound to miss some things, so feel free to include areas of argumentation I might have missed in the comments. Likewise, feel free to attack any of the claims I make. However, if you are going to attack my claims, it must be from a Scriptural basis. Simply saying ""well we just need to love people"" or ""well actually you are wrong"" without pointing to any sort of evidence are NOT sufficient arguments.

**Also, be sure to read the ENTIRE post before writing your arguments**. You will find I repeat some things, or address some arguments later in the post, so this is to save you from writing a lot and then realizing I addressed it later in the post.

Also, a note to the affirming Christians here: I understand you have your reasons for believing the way you do. I notice it usually comes from a few places.

1. You may not care (or know) what Scripture says regarding homosexual acts, and base your theology on what makes people the most happy or what is ""loving"" to others.
2. You reject Paul and the Apostles words as authoritative, and only focus on the words of Jesus who never directly talks about homosexual acts.
3. You reject traditional Biblical theology and appeal to the culture of the time over the words within Scripture.
4. You theologically believe that the Bible is affirming of monogamous same-sex marriages. **I hope to address all of these issues here as well.**

Also, before I jump in I want to clarify here the difference between homosexual desires or temptations and homosexual acts. It is quite simple.  
**- Homosexual acts or lust = sinful**  
**- Homosexual desires or temptation = not sinful**  
Everyone faces some degree of sexual temptation, no matter whom they are attracted to. Dwelling on immoral sexual thoughts or acting on immoral sexual impulses is sin. Intentionally seeking out situations which are likely to be tempting is also inappropriate for the Christian. Simply having those temptations or desires is not sin.

I will be pulling from the NIV version, the ESV Study Bible, [Blue Letter Bible](http://blueletterbible.org/), [Reformation Project](http://reformationproject.org/) (for the affirming argument), Dr. Preston Sprinkle, and various other websites that I will try to remember to link when used for my information. I hope you will see it is well researched and Biblically sound. (But I am by no means a scholar, don't claim to be, and likely will get some things wrong).

Lastly, I want to remember the words of Galatians 6:2 that say ""**carry each other's burdens, and in that way you will fulfill the law of Christ.**"" Let us be respectful and loving, carrying each other's burdens no matter how difficult so that we might fulfill the Law of Christ.

# BODY (PART 1)

Now I want to first look at what the Bible says, and some of the arguments for and against. The verses I will be looking at primarily are **Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13, Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9, and 1 Timothy 1:8-10**.

>**Leviticus** [18:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+18%3A22&version=NIV) **&** [20:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A13&version=NIV) - ""Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable"" & ""If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.""

We see here that the Bible is clearly and unequivocally saying homosexual acts are sinful, and that the penalty is death. Case closed right? Well, there is one problem with Christians using these verses to show that homosexual acts are sinful. **Christians aren't under the Mosaic Law anymore.** The Law of Moses was fulfilled by Christ on the cross, and is no longer in effect (Galatians 3:24-25). So every single time you, as a Christian, use these verses to prove that homosexual acts are sinful, you are performing (in my opinion) **questionable** [exegesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis). I believe that these verses are not the ones you should be referring to in order to prove your point.

Of course, it is important to also point out that there is differing Christian thought in regards to if certain commands in Leviticus 18 - 20 are **still** authoritative for us today. I don't want to get into that argumentation on this post but [here](https://bibleproject.com/podcast/which-laws-still-apply/), [here](https://www.olivetree.com/blog/old_testament_law_still_apply/), and [here](https://www.gotquestions.org/Christian-law.html) are helpful articles that go into more detail for those who aren't familiar with this type of theology. If one believes that laws related to homosexual acts in chapters 18 - 20 are still authoritative to us today, then that is basically end of the argument. The verses are very conclusive and even an affirming Christian wouldn't be able to argue against them (**affirming Christians hold the stance that they aren't authoritative anymore**). I encourage you to research those chapters and figure out where you fall on the issue. As I stated, I don't personally believe they are authoritative for us anymore, but that any laws mentioned again in the New Testament reaffirms the authoritativeness of those OT laws.

I want to clarify as well that I am not saying we should throw away or abolish the OT Law. I do not believe that at all, because obviously we see Jesus and the Apostles quote the OT and they aren't committing ""questionable"" exegesis as mentioned above. However, I do think there is a difference between Jesus and the Apostles using the OT Law against Jewish people in their time vs. Christians using the OT Law against people today. Still I want to affirm that the OT Law has not been abolished, but fulfilled, and the OT Law still has uses such as helping to lead people to the Grace of Jesus (Galatians 3:4). Lastly, there are Christians who say we are still required to follow the entire Mosaic Law. **You are wrong**. We are not. This post isn't about that, but you can read more [here](https://www.gotquestions.org/Christian-law.html) (this article is the same as the one posted above).

>[**Romans 1:26-27**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A26-27&version=NIV) - ""Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their woman exchange natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.""

**Context:** 

The context of these verses is Paul talking about how the righteousness of God is being revealed through his wrath, since **all** have sinned against God. It is important to recognize that he is talking about the present reality, not the past, even if he might be using hyperbole. Of course, Paul is sure to mention that we are forgiven of our sins if we are in Christ, but that we must turn away from our sins. In verse 21 we see that the root sin is the failure to value God above all other things, and in verse 23 we see that idolatry is the fundamental sin that results from that. Because of people's idolatry ""[God gave them over](https://www.gotquestions.org/God-gave-them-over.html)"" to their sins which is where 26-27 picks up. The contrast we see in these verses is that just like how idolatry is unnatural, so to are homosexual acts and lust.

**Traditional View:** 

In these verses we see Paul confirming that homosexual acts are sinful. We also see that not SIMPLY homosexual acts, but **ALSO** such passions and desires are dishonorable to God. Now you may be saying, didn't I say above that desires weren't sinful? And also, where does it even say that in the text? Yes I did, and good question! The word it is using in the verse is ""lust"" but technically ""desire"" is a more accurate translation. However, the word ""desire"" in the original language is ""orexis"" which means ""longing"" or ""craving for."" It isn't just ""oh I find the same sex attractive"" like we may think desire to be in our culture. **Lust is simply the most accurate way to communicate that.** So we see that it is saying that people were exchanging normal sexual desires (a woman with a man) for unnatural ones (a woman with a woman) because God gave them up to their lusts. **This part is critical to understanding the verse**. It isn't just talking about homosexual lust, as some might say, but the nature of physical relationships themselves. Idolatry is the initial sin, but the result of that is **more** sin, because God gave them over. We see this when it says they received ""due penalty for their error"" which could refer to the sin of homosexuality itself, as a result of idolatry and lust, or some additional consequence that isn't named here. However, there is no doubt by the language used here and the original text that the act of lusting **AND** the act of homosexuality itself is considered sinful here.

I believe it is also useful here to discuss the words ""natural"" and ""unnatural"" in the above verses. The word ""natural"" in the original Greek is ""[physikos](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5446/esv/mgnt/0-1/)"" which can mean something produced by nature, agreeable to nature, or governed by (the instincts of) nature. The common definition accepted with the word used in Romans is ""agreeable to nature"" which is Paul saying that heterosexual sex is what is the natural (agreeable) position, and therefore, anything outside of that would be ""not agreeable"" to nature. Of course, someone might argue that the ""natural"" referred to here is monogamous relationships, and non-monogamous relationships are the unnatural, but that line of argument doesn't hold when you know the culture behind monogamous and non-monogamous relationships during that time, which I go into more detail later in this post. I also discuss more below regarding the word unnatural right below this. **For more details regarding Romans**, I highly recommend reading what Preston Sprinkle has written on the topic [here](https://theologyintheraw.com/the-sin-of-homosexuality/) (I used a good bit of his article to create this post).

**Affirming View:** 

The common affirming rebuttal here is that this verse is only talking about ""lusting"" but not sexual orientation. Of course, that view is simply incorrect when understanding the Scriptures. First, the wording doesn't support that claim at all. If the issue was simply lust, then there would be no reason to include specific sexual preferences. Some commentators say that in the ancient world it was assumed people could be satisfied with heterosexual sex, and to go beyond was due to insatiable lust. However, we know that Paul was also against heterosexual sex if it was outside the confines of marriage. Therefore, it makes no sense for him only to go after non-marital homosexual sex and leave out heterosexual sex. Since Paul is clearly making a distinction by specifically mentioning homosexual sex, we have to assume he is talking about those acts on top of the lust itself.

People may also want to point out that the words Paul uses in Romans ([physis](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5449/esv/mgnt/0-1/)) are also the same words he uses when talking about hair length for Christians in Corinthians, and Paul's words regarding hair length are opinions, not authoritative. That is true. Paul isn't making an authoritative claim when discussing hair length, but to say ""the words are the same, therefore it means the same"" is very dishonest. Words can have more than 1 meaning. In this case, we need to primarily look at the word ([atimia](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g819/kjv/mgnt/0-1/)) which is translated into ""disgrace"" or ""vile"" in English. The Romans meaning of that word could accurately be described as ""base lusts or vile passions"" while the Corinthian meaning of that word could accurately be described as ""dishonor."" That aligns with our understanding of the word physis because the word in Romans would be accurately described as ""against nature"" while the word in Corinthians would be accurately described as ""against natural sense or conviction."" One (Romans) is discussing what is contrary to the plan of nature (what is abnormal and perverse), while the other (Corinthians) is a natural conviction or knowledge that one should know.

Lastly, there are some who believe that Romans 1:26b doesn't mean females who have sex with females. One such article can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z8y0ByWzZDl5GsQS8iwl80h4bV2KvAYI/view?usp=drivesdk). (*It is important to mention that I can't find much about the author of the article, their credentials, or if they are even a Christian or not*). The author claims that Romans 1:26b is really talking about females who engage in non-procreative (non-vaginal) sex with men, and that it has been misunderstood. I have a few problems with the article (and don't think it changes anything about my argument) which I will explain later.

>[**1 Corinthians 6:9**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206%3A9-11&version=NIV) **&** [**1 Timothy 1:10**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim+1%3A8-10&version=NIV) - ""Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men"" & ""for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers - and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine.

**Context:** 

In 1 Tim 1:10, we see that the context is Paul writing to Timothy, his disciple. He is telling Timothy that he can tell people what they are teaching is false doctrine and to stop, since they don't know what they are talking about. He says they want to be teachers of the law, and that the law exists for rule breakers such as those mentioned in the verse above. We see here that the law being discussed is the New Law through Jesus Christ, not the Mosaic Law like in Leviticus. In 1 Cor, we see Paul giving warning to the church because of sexual immorality among them, and warns them of various things including what is in the verse above telling them that those people ""will not inherit the kingdom of God.""

**Traditional View:** 

These verses clearly show that homosexual acts are sinful. But in order to understand why, we need to look at the original language. In 1 Cor, we see the words ""men who have sex with men"" which is actually the English translation of two Greek words that refer to the passive and active participants in homosexual acts. The verse is basically saying ""neither \_\_\_\_\_\_ nor \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will inherit the kingdom of God."" The first is ""malakos"" which roughly translates to effeminate, and is referring to the passive partner in homosexual sex by most scholars (the one who is being penetrated). The next word is ""arsenokoites"" which is a compound word created by putting two words from Leviticus together. The two words are ""arsen"" which means male and ""koites"" which means bed, which are found in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13. This word created by Paul, who was a scholar for his time, is believed to mean ""men who bed men"" or ""men who have sex with men"" as in the verse above. So while we aren't under the Mosaic Law anymore, we see Paul clearly pulling from the Mosaic Law to affirm that homosexual acts are still sinful, despite the Law being fulfilled in Christ (remember that Apostles have the ability to speak authoritatively, so Paul can say that homosexual acts are sinful **only** if they actually are). Not only are homosexual acts sinful, but they are sinful for all people. They are sinful for the ones who are being penetrated AND they are sinful for the ones doing the penetrating. This is important to clarify because in Greek/Roman cultures, it was acceptable for a male of higher status to have sex with a male of lower status. However, Paul is going against that accepted dichotomy and saying it isn't okay in any capacity, even if the culture says it is.

Lastly, while the word ""malakos"" can have a more broad meaning as we will discuss below, ""arsenokoites"" has a more narrow meaning. We see arsenokoites always referring to men having sex with men in ancient literature, which includes post-New Testament literature like the Sibylline Oracles, Hippolytus' Refutation of All Heresies, and Eusebius' Preparation for the Gospel. Based on historical and literary context, there can be no doubt what these words mean. Similarly in 1 Tim 1:10, we see the same word ""arsenokoites"" used by Paul here.

**Affirming View:** 

Now the common affirming view is that these verses specifically address the exploitation of people, not loving and monogamous marriages between same-sex people. Specifically people will say that Paul is talking about grooming or pederasty of some kind. There are a few reasons affirming Christians come to this view, and I think they are all **extremely** weak. The first is that the Greek word ""malakos"" used above can be used to refer to a boy kept or used for homosexual relations with a man (a catamite). However, it can also be used to refer to a male who submits his body to unnatural lewdness or a male prostitute. **Remember, words can have more than just one specific meaning**. When we look at the context of what Paul is discussing, the context of the word he is using, and the context of the other word he uses to discuss homosexual acts, it is clear that Paul is not talking specifically about just catamite relationships, but **all** homosexual relationships. Affirming Christians will often say ""well monogamous same-sex relationships didn't really exist back then, so Paul wouldn't have even really known to denounce them"", but that isn't true. **Pederasty wasn’t the only form of same-sex relations common in their day**. Josephus speaks out **against same-sex relations in the context of marriage laws** (*Apion* 2.199), and several other Jewish writers prohibited homosexual relations without reference to age distinctions (*Letter of Aristeas* 152; *Ps. Phoc.* 3; *b. Sanhedrin* 58a, *Sifra Ahare* 9:8, and *Sifra* on Leviticus 18:3). Furthermore—*and most importantly*—pederasty didn’t exist among female same-sex relations, which were often **consensual** and **non-exploitative.** Still, Jewish and Christian authors unanimously prohibited female same-sex relations *on the same grounds that they prohibited male same-sex relations. -* [Dr. Preston Sprinkles](https://theologyintheraw.com/the-sin-of-homosexuality/).

Some will also inaccurately point out that Paul could have used already existing words to describe same-sex acts like ""erastes"" and ""eromenos"" but these words have contexts that directly and specifically reference pederastry or grooming relationships. Clearly, Paul NOT using those words is showing that he isn't talking just about certain homosexual relations, but ALL homosexual relations.

People will also claim that the word ""homosexuality"" didn't exist until the late 1800s, which is true. But that doesn't mean Paul didn't understand or have any idea what it was. Like all translation, we took the words used in the original text, and used a English word that best fit with the original text. Sometimes that words comes sooner, and sometimes that word comes later. Just because homosexuality wasn't a word until recently does nothing to change that Paul is clearly talking about homosexual acts of all kinds. In the case of Scripture, homosexuality made the most sense for some translations to include since Paul is clearly prohibiting what we would call today ""homosexuality."" Of course with that said, I do believe ""homosexuality"" isn't the best word to use, because Biblically it is the homosexual acts that are sinful, not the attraction. However, the word homosexuality can be used to refer to homosexual acts **OR** someone that is attracted to the same sex. As mentioned above, one can have an attraction to the same sex but resist their temptations and not sin. So in that regard, I want to affirm that one can be a ""homosexual"" (ie. they are attracted to the same sex) but still live a life honoring to the Lord, and also that the word choice isn't the best.

# CONCLUSION (PART 1)

In terms of the verses above (especially Romans) we need to ask the question, ""are Paul's words limited to a specific form of same-sex relation, or does his description include **all forms**, including consensual, monogamous, faithful same-sex relations. The biggest reasons I can't seem to agree with the idea of it only being related to rape or pederasty are as follows:

1. There are many Greek words used to describe pederasty, and none of them are used. There also isn't any mention of master-slave relations, rape, or prostitution. **Paul could have used the Greek word ""paiderastes"" to specifically show he was talking about pederasty, but didn't.**
2. Paul uses language of mutuality throughout the passage. ""males with other males"" but no mention of slaves, or creepy men with innocent boys. The language Paul uses is always equal relationships.
3. In this time female same-sex relationships were largely consensual, and yet Paul considers these to be against nature still, and compares them to male same-sex relationships.
4. Paul doesn't say that people exchanged non-lustful, consensual forms of sexual relations for lustful, oppressive forms. Rather, he says that they exchanged opposite sex relations for same-sex relations. Therefore, the idea that it is specifically about lust doesn't make sense. Again, Paul could have said that.

As I have mentioned before, you can get **a LOT more detail regarding the points above by reading Preston Sprinkle's article**. Simply just reading these points might be sufficient, but you can gain a lot of context and information that you won't get just by reading this. ***And the article isn't that long!***

I want to end this section by speaking to those (again) who are **too focused**, in my opinion, **about the cultural context of the time**. Cultural context should absolutely be used to understand Scripture, but it cannot be held up as the same or greater than Scripture. There is no amount of cultural context in the world that would make what Paul says NOT mean all homosexual acts, because if that was the case then Paul could have simply said that. **But he didn't**. He never once clarifies that these homosexual acts are only sinful under certain conditions. There were plenty of examples of all kinds of homosexual acts in his time, and he choose to not speak specifically on any of them. Rather, he choose to speak broadly about all homosexual acts. Therefore, any Bible believing Christian **MUST** take Paul at his word based on the context of Scripture and original language. To appeal to the culture at the time as a way to undermine Paul's words is putting the culture above what Paul himself said. Not to mention, if we believe that God spoke through the Kings, Prophets, Jesus, and the Apostles in order to create His Holy Scripture, **we can surely believe that God is capable of giving Paul words that would transcend his cultural understanding** in order to make it clear to us that homosexual acts were permissible. But again, he didn't. If we fixate too much on culture and say ""well Paul wouldn't have had any knowledge of X type of relationship, so clearly he isn't talking about X"" then we are making God and the Bible less.

# BODY (PART 2)

Now I want to tackle some of the common reasons affirming Christians believe what they do, as mentioned above.

**1. You may not care (or know) what Scripture says regarding homosexual acts, and base your theology on what makes people the most happy or what is ""loving"" to others.**

* It is totally understandable that you may have been misled into believing homosexual acts were okay. We live in a culture that cares less about Biblical accuracy and more about making sure people feel included. And I want people to feel included, but not by sacrificing the truth of Scripture. That is not what Jesus wanted. Jesus wanted us to love others AND hold to Biblical truth. He wanted us to have compassion for those who were suffering, while remaining faithful to Scripture. As Christians, we cannot just base our theology on what makes people the most happy or because ""it isn't hurting anyone"" because if it is sinful, it doesn't matter how happy it makes someone or if it doesn't hurt anyone, **it is still sin**. As Christians, we are called to affirm the truth of Scripture, no matter how much we don't like it. And I agree with you! I don't like that homosexual acts are sinful. I wish same-sex attracted people could get married and have families. **But I can't ignore Scripture just because I don't like what it says**. I have to follow all of it, or none of it. I don't get to pick and choose, because then I'm not really a Christian, but just using Christianity to feel good about myself.
* And side note, to any Christians who are concerned by my language above saying ""I don't like that homosexual acts are a sin"", I want to clarify some things. I think it's totally fine to say essentially ""yeah I don't understand this, and if I was God, maybe I'd do it differently"" while also being able to say ""I am not God, will never be God, and am called to love and honor Him completely, no matter what His law says. And also, I recognize His law is fully loving and good for all people."" That is basically what I am saying above. We must love God's Law and follow it no matter what, even if we don't understand it.

**2. You reject Paul and the Apostles words as authoritative, and only focus on the words of Jesus who never directly talks about homosexual acts.**

* The Bible is clear that the Apostles spoke authoritatively ([including Paul](https://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/stewart_don/faq/bible-authoritative-word/question21-paul-considered-authoritative.cfm)), and that their words are the same as Jesus's words in truth and authority (of course they can't speak anything authoritatively that would be against God's character, because the Holy Spirit is within them assisting them through their writing). At the end of the day, I can't convince you of that, but the early church held to that view (and they knew Jesus and the Apostles), so who am I to disagree with them AND what Scripture says? **Jesus's words are SO important, but so are the Apostles words.**
* Also, while Jesus never directly talks about homosexual acts we do see him in [Matthew 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019&version=NIV) affirm that marriage is between a man and a woman. If Jesus didn't talk about homosexuality because he truly believed it was okay, then he could have affirmed that here easily. Yet he says a man with a woman, not 1 person with 1 person regardless of gender. Some might say ""yeah well if he said that he would have been killed because that was blasphemy"" but Jesus literally did that multiple times and the Jews wanted to kill him. Why would he all of a sudden care about blasphemy and the Jews trying to kill him in this instance, but not the ones before? Of course, some may also appeal to [polygamy](https://www.logos.com/grow/does-jesus-contradict-the-old-testament-on-polygamy/) as well when we think about ""Biblical"" marriage, but I don't think it's good argument or relevant, and won't spend the time on it here.
* Lastly, we see that Jesus's ministry was focused toward Jews, while Paul's ministry was focused toward Greeks (and other non-Jews). The Jews, after the return to Jerusalem under the Persian Empire, realized that their exile and slavery was due to their lack of faith toward God. So Jewish culture was basically rehauled, and they turned toward God and very strictly shunned anything that was outside or against their faith (and followed the OT Law). That is the same culture we see during Jesus's ministry. **So the Jews heavily opposed Greek/Roman culture, and the Greek/Roman culture was the culture that was open to homosexual acts as mentioned above**. Since Jesus's ministry was to the Jews, he had no reason to address homosexuality because it was a part of the Greek/Roman culture that Jews had already rejected. Also, Jesus didn't need to address it because **the OT Law had already addressed it**, since at this point the Jews were still under the OT Law, which prohibited homosexuality. Lastly, Paul DOES mention it which makes sense because his ministry was to the Gentiles, with cultures that approved of homosexual acts. **Jesus didn't mention it because he didn't have to, Paul mentioned it because he did have to.**

**3. You reject traditional Biblical theology and appeal to the culture of the time over the words within Scripture.**

* As explained above, we can see that traditional Biblical theology is definitely on my side. It takes EXTREME logical leaps to believe that the Bible isn't talking about all types of homosexual relationships. Likewise, we can see that the culture of that time still affirms the points I made above. It wasn't like the culture was ONLY grooming or pederasty, but monogamous relationships as well. Are there places in the Bible where we can appeal to culture as a way to say something is or isn't for us today? Yes absolutely. However, the context of Scripture often makes it very clear what is just a cultural command or idea, and what is authoritative. In the instance of homosexuality, the context makes it clear that it isn't just something for that culture, and not us today, especially because it comes up multiple times in Scripture, not just once in a specific book of the NT. Some may try to point out the specific sexual/relational cultures of the Greek or Roman empires during those times, and point out that the church likely evaluated things differently than we would today. They will point out how those cultures viewed monogamous female relationships, and bring up fears those cultures had relating to men's and women's roles in society. They may also point out how male-male sex was inherently dishonorable in that culture for the person being penetrated (that person having a lesser societal role) vs. male-male sex today not making 1 person more dishonorable or socially lesser. Lastly, they may mention how homosexual acts were viewed as lacking self-control or having an out-of-control sexuality.
* **I wholly reject these claims as proof that homosexual acts are permissible today for a few reasons.**
   * **1.** The gospel is counter-cultural. It is likely Paul knows about these things (although he doesn't care to mention them as qualifiers in the Bible), but the gospel and the words Paul spoke during that time were very much against the norm. It is very likely that this instance is the same. Paul is making a counter cultural claim that all homosexual acts, no matter if you are the active or passive partners, are sinful. Or that no matter what anyone thinks, it is still sinful (ie. ""can two females ***really*** have sex?"" was a thought in that day, because penetration couldn't occur)
   * **2.** I already mentioned it, but Paul doesn't make any sort of distinction regarding any of these cultural ideals. He doesn't talk about how the Greeks or Romans viewed sex, he doesn't talk about how it isn't okay ONLY in certain contexts like if the acts are with someone of lesser societal value, etc. He just plainly says it is wrong, according to the evidence provided above.
   * **3.** I believe that the Lord has spoken through the Bible, using people like Paul, and that it is a book that spans times and cultures. If the Lord really wanted us to take into account all of these different cultural ideas, then he would have made sure Paul talked about it. But that didn't happen. To say, ""well the culture was very different and there clearly weren't any homosexual acts of people that had equal status unlike today, therefore homosexual acts today are acceptable"" is just stretching what it means to view the Bible in an inappropriate cultural lens. It is using the culture to control the truth of the Bible and it is reading things into the Bible that God clearly didn't want to be in it. If an all-powerful God wanted us to know that homosexual acts today were okay due to cultural reasons, **then that would have been made clear in the Bible**. Similarly to the ideas of tattoos. It is very easy to make an argument that tattoos aren't sinful culturally and Biblically anymore. We never see any prohibition against it, expect in the Old Testament. But as mentioned, we aren't under the Old Testament Laws anymore. Likewise, we can easily see that tattoos in that time were used for idol worship, which is the main reason the Lord banned them. Now if the New Testament said that tattoos were banned, then I think it wouldn't be enough to just say ""well culturally they were mostly used for idol worship, and so they are okay to get"" but that we really need to think **""Why did the Bible not put these cultural justifications in it?""** Is it because they forgot? Is it because they just hoped we'd figure it out? *Or is it because the cultural justifications don't matter in some instances*? In this instance, I think one can conclude, if they are being intellectually honest with all that has been stated above, that the cultural argument is not enough to believe homosexual acts are permissible today.

**4. You theologically believe that the Bible is affirming of monogamous same-sex marriages.**

* As shown above, there is no way one can be intellectually honest and believe the Bible affirms monogamous same-sex marriages. If one believes that, it is likely because they either just want to believe what makes people happy regardless of what Scripture says or they deny Paul's writings. Both of which are things one cannot do and honestly call themselves a Christian for.

# CONCLUSION (PART 2)

Ultimately there is nothing I can really do to convince you. If you are a Christian, the Holy Spirit will have to do that. But I hope this can help give you more knowledge on what the Bible really says regarding this issue. It is definitely complicated, but I believe it is the duty of all Christians to be highly educated on it. And as I said, don't take my words for anything. Read what I said above, look at Scripture, look up commentaries, and learn more yourself! Also, pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes and mind to understand or see what you might not have seen before.

And lastly, **it is imperative that Christians love others.** Some will say ""well you want to say that homosexual acts are sinful, so you can't be loving"" and I don't believe that. We can hold truth to Scripture and love others well, share the gospel with them, disciple them, etc. So I pray that you can know and experience the Lord deeper, and that you would continue to grow in your faith.

2025-06-24 21:39:21,"New Inferno trait is transformative. Some early explorations Discoveries day! I was curious to see how ""burning now scales off your Power"" was going to work, especially in contrast to Persisting Flames, another power-DPS trait. It's a pretty dramatic piece of tech, and I thought it'd be cool to sculpt a build around it.

Using all-Berserkers, Force sigil, Scholar runes, no might or any other additive:

* Dagger2, Drake's Breath, is 11 000 damage on a 4s CD, up from 5851
* Pistol can be a power DPS now, sort of (not as good as scepter for it)
* Scepter auto is 3178 damage per hit up from 1879
* Signet of Fire is 10k damage on 12s CD up from 3144
* Hammer's Flame Wheel now pulses 361 up from 117, and grand finale is 4820 damage, up from 1572

Now, with just these, this is already plenty transformative. It's not as much damage as pure-condi Vipers, but it is kind of neat to be able to use a Fire Wizard build with weapons normally designed for condition damage, but to also take advantage of the power options the weapon has as well.

But more discoveries:

* The condition damage from Vipers does nothing for this kind of damage anymore, but the ***Expertise***, that still increases our damage output, the same way that a Superior Sigil of Smoldering would.
* **Swapping all gear to Vigilant, with +Power and +Toughness, +concentration and +expertise**, is a massive loss on critical hit chance and crit damage, but grants +42.2% boon duration (same as Ritualists, less than Diviners), and +1172 points of Toughness (enough to drop some test attacks on me by \~40% of the damage).
* Most notably, if we swap to **Superior Rune of the Flame Legion**, we actually OVERCAP on burning duration, using all-Vigilant and the duration increase from Burning Precision, even without a Sigil of Smoldering. This means we have some flexibility, and can play with traits like Conjurer or Burning Fire if we'd like, but also means we can just swap out helmet, shoulders, gloves, backpack, and amulet back to Berserkers, getting some of our crit chance and crit damage back and getting even MORE damage out of burning from the extra Power, but dropping our boon duration and damage reduction by -10% each, down to \~30%.
* (Swapping to Superior Rune of the Baelfire is comparable, but trades 10% burning duration for 10% on all conditions, and we don't care as much about that. We're Fire Wizards, after all.)
* If we use a Superior Sigil of Smoldering, instead, we can hit 100% bonus burning duration with just chest, gloves, and amulet as Vigilant (someone might squeeze more stats out of it, I'm spitballing) for the best Damage, Crit Chance, and Crit Multiplier that we can get, with a sprinkling of Toughness and Concentration.

With the above setup, we have some flexibility whether to use Air (crit chance, ferocity, fury, and bonus damage, or Arcane (burning on crit, and a 15k burning explosion when dodging). Air is notably focused on strike damage though, which our burning is not, so it creates a bit of a headscratcher for how best to approach it. Similarly, I'd thought to use the Relic of Fire, and build around fire auras that can inflict more burning, but that's a strike damage increase. I might end up using something like Relic of the Steamshrieker, which is \~8k worth of burning when blasting/leaping a water field, but it might get kind of weird.

* Dagger2, Drake's Breath, up to 16k total damage on a 4s CD
* Scepter autos are 4399 damage
* Signet of Fire is 16k total damage on 12s CD
* Hammer's Flame Wheel now pulses 594 damage, and grand finale burns for 7932

2019-06-05 15:17:36,"When The Gods Come to Visit “It is quite apparent,” Issa’Vala addressed the council, making sure that her numerous head tentacles were flowing naturally towards her back, as if she were swimming with the current in a swiftly moving river. She took a deep breath and did her best to remain calm and confident in what she was about to say. Appearances were everything when addressing the venerable women that ruled over the city of Ploria when Queen Issa’Ral was away on campaign. “That what our great city of Ploria has, is a Guardian Star.”

“That is ridiculous, child,” Sha’Ven spoke at once, her head tentacles slithering every which way, displaying her annoyance. Issa’Vala knew she’d be the first to dismiss her claims. One of the oldest members of the council, Sha’Ven was like a rock facing the tides, unrelenting and immovable. “We know the stories. The signs that the goddesses have sent us in the past, during times of need or indecision. Large stars visible during the day, cutting wide strokes of light like a painter’s brush on clay, moving deliberately through the Gate of Heaven. The light over Ploria is neither large nor moving.”

“Which is why I chose my words carefully, Sha’Ven,” Issa’Vala replied coolly as she turned to face her in the marble Council Chamber. “I did not infer that the light over Ploria is a sign from the goddesses, or that it was even sent by the goddesses. What I am saying, is that the star is always visible, day or night. It also does not move, remaining firmly above the palace in Ploria. It is not large, not like the signs of old. It is the same size as all the other stars at night. Hence, it is something we have not seen before, something the gods have not done before. Something new that has to be given a name. Therefore, I claim it to be a Guardian Star.”

“Stars are in the domain of the Heavenly Realm,” Fle’Korth said simply. She was always a staunch traditionalist. Goddesses forbid if she actually had to embrace something new. “There is no precedent for this, for something new. How can this be? The Heavenly Realm has been and always will be, ‘new’ just does not happen.”

“It must be a trick,” Ola’Asth said immediately. She was always concerned with the well-being of the realm and its defense. More often than not, that included going to war to maintain the realm’s safety. “Perhaps it is some trick with mirrors. Something those crafty Lokrans created. They have hated us for centuries. I bet they are behind this.”

“Perhaps Issa’Vala has an answer to what this ‘Guardian Star’ is and its possible meaning,” Issa’Kah interrupted. Issa’Kah was always the level-headed one. Wanting to hear out any argument fully before coming to a decision. The fact that she was Issa’Vala’s aunt had nothing to do with it. Probably. “I implore the council to give her the floor to explain herself.”

“Thank you, Issa’Kah,” Issa’Vala said, bowing her head slightly towards her. She took that brief moment to look over her tunic, making sure it was still presentable and unwrinkled. Finding it satisfactory, she continued. “Since I highly doubt that the Lokrans could even conceive of something like this, it is safe to say they are not behind it. And, as written in the sacred texts, our ancestors took great care to write about every celestial sign they witnessed. Because this has not been seen before, it is either something new from the goddesses, or it is not of the goddesses. At the moment, it does not appear malevolent. Otherwise disaster would surely rain down upon Ploria. I would like to give it the benefit of the doubt and claim it to be benevolent. But what is apparent, is that there is much we do not know. Currently, for all I know, this could be the birth of a new goddess.”

“Nonsense,” Sha’Ven said. “It could simply be a new star, that is all. Issa’Vala is just spouting any idea that comes to mind, hoping something sticks. Typical of the third in line for the throne. They always have to ‘discover’ something new to remain relevant for the throne will never be theirs.”

Issa’Vala would be the first to tell someone that she was a scholar first, and a warrior second. The fact that she was royalty would be among the last things she would tell a person, if it even came up. That Sha’Ven would instantly assume that she was doing this merely for fame or glory cut deep to her second heart. Her head tentacles started to spread in an obvious show of anger before she shook her head and calmed herself once again.

“A new star that does not move even as the night progresses?” Issa’Vala asked quizzically. “All stars move except the northern star.”

“It is a more likely answer than the birth of new goddess.” Sha’Ven replied dismissively. “Leave this matter to the priestesses.”

“The birth of Goddesses has only happened once anyways, when the first waves crashed upon the shore,” Fle’Korth explained. “When that occurred, the ‘Gates of Heaven shone like the sun, and night was banished from the world for a lunar cycle’. The Gates of Heaven are not currently shining, and night almost upon us. I highly doubt the birth of a new Goddess is on the horizon. It could very well just be a new star, as much as I hate to say it.”

“Regardless, I was merely stating my openness to any and all theories that could explain this star,” Issa’Vala said boldly. “Which is what makes me the perfect woman to lead the investigation into it and discover its secrets. Rest assured, no matter what theory ends up being true or what new discoveries I make, I will not hide anything from the council.”

“Well, she has plainly made her case,” Issa’Kah said. “The truth of the matter is that there is much unknown about this new celestial event, what it is or what it intends. I say we give full investigative authority to Issa’Vala so she can further delve into these mysteries and deliver her findings to us. Those in favor?”

A number of hands went up, not all of them. Full investigative authority meant a budget. She truly would be able to spend her time delving into this mystery.

“Any opposed?”

No hands went up. Sha’Ven did take the opportunity to sneer at Issa’Vala before looking elsewhere. Issa’Vala shrugged mentally. A reef fish never changes its stripes.

“It is decided then. Issa’Vala shall be the Guardian of the ‘Guardian Star’.” With that, Issa’Kah smacked her brass gavel against her marble desk, considering the matter settled.

\-------------------------------------------------------------

It wasn’t the first time Issa’Vala found herself looking up in the sky, staring at the ever-present, immobile star above Ploria. But it was the first time that it actually hurt.

“Aw come on, that was way too easy!” Kal’Eva said, soon coming into Issa’Vala’s field of vision, staring down at her. She was smiling, but the smile was slowly fading as she extended her hand out to Issa’Vala. “You usually last more than a few seconds!”

Issa’Vala sighed and took Kal’Eva’s hand, soon getting to her feet. Kal’Eva started to dust her off.

“You were thinking about it again,” Kal’Eva stated very matter-of-factly. “You know you can ill afford to do that in combat.”

“I know that ‘Eva!” Issa’Vala snapped. “I just-”

Kal’Eva immediately cast down her eyes and her head tentacles in a sign of deference. “It is not my place to tell my Lady what to do or what not to do.”

Issa’Vala sighed and threw a punch at ‘Eva’s shoulder. “Come now, we’re past that and you know it.”

‘Eva merely laughed. “Well I had to at least try to get your mind off that blasted thing. It has been, what, seven lunar cycles? Nothing has changed. Let not your mind be troubled by it.”

“It has to be there for a reason! But that reason eludes me!” Issa’Vala exclaimed, kicking the sand beneath her feet. “And I have searched the texts! Countless texts! Old scrolls! Scripture and non scripture. History, stories, plays, anything I could get my hands on and nothing!”

‘Eva shrugged as she picked up ‘Vala’s brass spear from the ground, handing it back to her. “So it is completely new. We do have more pressing matters to attend to at the moment. Queen Issa’Ral and your sister, Issa’Yai, are out on the front lines against the coming Lokran incursion.”

“Please, as if the Lokran, of all people, are any threat to us Plorians,” Issa’Vala said dismissively as she grabbed her spear.

“If,” Kal’Eva continued. “Goddesses forbid, something were to happen to them, we have to be ready to fight for our lives against the Lokran. Last we heard, they had gathered in numbers we have never seen before. And with...”

“‘With Issa’Kala ruling from the palace, it is up to me to lead the defenders and protect Ploria.’” Issa’Vala finished the sentence for her with the practiced air of someone who has heard it numerous times before. “Keep this up ‘Eva and I might just start calling you ‘mother’.”

‘Eva stumbled back, her hand clutching her chest where her second heart would be in obvious mockery. “Ah! You wound me ‘Vala! I hope to be dead and sunken before you compare me to her!”

There was a moment of hesitation, before both women burst out in laughter, patting each other on the back.

“Ah, ‘Eva, but you can hardly expect me to take the Lokrans seriously can you? They are barbarians after all. How many times have we and our ancestors beaten them? A hun-”

It was at this time, that the ever-present star above Ploria, a source of consternation and many a sleepless night for Issa’Vala, shone a brilliant orange. Brilliant and bright that it outshone the sun. So bright and vivid that Issa’Vala had to look away lest her unworthy eyes burned in their sockets. Then just as soon as it happened, the flash was gone, and so was the star.

“It disappeared,” Issa’Vala simply stated, a look of incredulity covering her face. “Why in the world would it be gone now of all times? What has changed?!”

At that moment, a horn sound out among the city walls. Then another, and a third. Issa’Vala’s head tentacles twisted up with themselves. She knew what the horns meant. Their forces had met defeat in battle, and now the enemies were fast approaching the city. A siege was imminent. And with no army, that also meant the survival of their people depended on the outcome of that siege. ‘Eva and ‘Vala looked at each other worryingly.

“This could be the end of Ploria’s story,” Kal’Eva said with Issa’Vala nodding in grim agreement. “Did we grow too complacent? We might have to make deals that we do not like just to ensure that Ploria survives. How many of our people will need to be given away into slavery? Will the Lokrans even accept that? They have hated us for so long they may just want to get rid of us for good.”

Issa’Vala didn’t know the answer. Her mind was numb, the Lokrans were knocking at their door. Her mother and sister were surely dead, they wouldn’t have suffered the dishonor of being the first Plorians to lose to the Lokrans in over ten generations.

They gathered themselves and their equipment. There was no time for worrying. Mourning would come later, the lives of those who yet live were their responsibility. But just as they were about to leave the training yard, another light appeared in the sky that started off as a dull orange but soon glowed larger and brighter.

“Wait, that...that is a sign from the gods. It has to be!” Issa’Vala said excitedly as she pointed at the light with her spear. “It is just as described in the sacred texts! A large star cutting a swath of light through the sky!”

“Wait, but it is not heading towards the Gate of Heaven,” Kal’Eva observed. “It looks like it is heading towards the Anrath mountains.”

Issa’Vala looked over the light and it’s path. It indeed seemed to be heading right for the Anrath mountains to the south. After a brief moment, a dawning realization came to her. “It is not just a sign. It has to be help! Coming down from the heavens to aid us in our dire time of need! It could be a relic, or sacred armor, or a weapon, or maybe even a goddess!”

“W-what? What are you talking about?” ‘Eva placed her hands on ‘Vala’s shoulders and shook her gaze away from the falling star. “Do you understand what you are saying? The goddesses abandoned the realm, leaving it to us mortals. They vowed never to step foot on the shores of creation ever again! Everything we do on this realm is of our own accord. What reward we receive in the afterlife is based on our own merit and actions. They only guide, they never interfere!”

Issa’Vala placed her hand on Kal’Eva’s shoulder. “Kal’Eva, I have to go, and I have to go now before the city is surrounded. Wherever that star lands, I know it will be the salvation of Ploria. I know reasoning will not sway you. But this has to be the reason that star was there in the first place. I have to go.”

“But the city needs you! You have to lead the defense!”

“Captain Kal’Eva, I entrust the city’s defense to you. You have my full and utmost confidence in your abilities.” Issa’Vala said as she reached into her satchel and pulled out a small, red coral medallion, granting her full command of the city’s defenses. “Lead well. Make no deals of slavery or surrender. Hold out until I return, with salvation riding on my shoulders! I promise you that!”

Kal’Eva was about to protest, but that look in Issa’Vala’s eyes convinced her not to. She could see that ‘Vala, her dear friend, was determined and driven, perhaps for the first time in her life. Instead, all Kal’Eva could do was salute, her right hand over her first heart, her left hand over her second heart. “May Ishla guide your steps and hasten your return.”

Issa’Vala returned the salute, slung her shield over her shoulder, and took her leave. Kal’Eva watched her friend depart with a forlorn look on her face. She was quite certain that this would be the last time she’d ever see her liege.

\---------------------------------------------------

Eventually, the falling star did land in the Anrath mountains, just as Kal’Eva predicted. The sizable explosion that occurred after it collided with the range was visible even from the Plorian walls. As Isha’Vala snuck out of the city, she also noticed a small squadron of the Lokran invaders splitting off and heading towards the mountains as well. Issa’Vala cursed, they were riding corhans. She’d have to hurry. There was no way in the deep she was going to let those Lokrans get to the goddess first.

The journey was harrowing. In her haste, she had neglected to pack enough food for the trip. She ate what she could while travelling, just to keep herself going, but soon enough it didn’t matter. Soon, she no longer felt hunger. She only felt the encroaching weight of her people’s survival on her shoulders. With each hour that passed, the impending sense of doom only grew. She started travelling through the night, with only the light of the moons to guide her.

Through sheer determination and tenacity, she trudged through the thick jungle. She secretly thanked the goddess La’Lo’Vey that she didn’t bring her heavy iron cuirass. It would only slow her down in this environment. She needed to remain light if she was to remain in front of the Lokrans.

She constantly thought of what she would say to the goddess once she met her. What prayers she would say, what motions she would take, what deals or promises she would make. She was quite certain that if it came down to it, she would sacrifice her life for her people.

Finally, after four days of near nonstop journeying, she arrived at the clearing where the star had fallen. It would have taken at least a week if she had traveled normally. She was beyond exhausted. As she approached the edge of the clearing, she realized it wasn’t so much a clearing, as a massive hole in the ground. As if an angry giant had punched the ground. Fallen trees and burnt up plant life littered the sides of the crater. It was at least three times as large as the town square in Ploria. And there, what lay in the middle of it, shook Issa’Vala to her core.

It was a small metallic...egg. Issa’Vala had no other way to describe it. It was made of such fine metal that shone like the sun on one side. It was so mirror-like that she could have sworn it was made entirely out of silver. The other side appeared blackened, as if it had been burnt. Falling from heaven must have been quite the ordeal. She slid down the sides of the crater, carefully maintaining her balance as she reached the bottom. It was much larger than she originally thought. It would scarcely fit in the training ground.

As she approached, it made a sound. A harrowing sound that made her head tentacles stand on end. But the more she listened to it, it sounded almost like the crashing of waves. A constant crashing of waves upon the shore. Was it trying to soothe her? Remind her of home? Maybe it was reassurance, that her journey was not in vain.

She finally reached the metallic egg. It was covered in writing, or at least she assumed it was writing. Writing of the goddesses, no doubt. Was she even worthy to gaze upon it? She wasn’t immediately struck down, so she supposed she was safe, for now. She reached out and lightly touched it, and yes it was metal. And it was incredibly smooth, so smooth that even if the blacksmiths at home polished iron for months, it wouldn’t nearly be as smooth as this. It truly was from the heavens, she concluded. But where was the relic? The armor? The weapon? The Goddess?

If this great metallic egg was indeed like an egg, then perhaps what she needed was inside. But when would it hatch? Soon, she prayed. Or was she supposed to break the egg herself? She lightly drummed her fingers impatiently on side of the egg while she thought, causing resounding metallic sounds to reverberate throughout structure. Much to her shock, she heard a distinctive knocking answer her drumming, followed by more sounds of crashing waves.

Cautiously, Issa’Vala knocked three times. Three more knocks answered her. So there was to be no relic or weapon, but an actual birth of a Goddess? Oh how fortuitous that she arrived when she did! To be able to witness the birth of a Goddess was perhaps a once in existence event. The knocking from inside, however, did not stop. The sounds of crashing waves did not stop. Instead, the knocking seemed to be moving. She followed the sound, knocking all along the way. The knocking continued to move until she reached a blackened part of the metallic egg. There was an obvious cut into the side, curiously door shaped. Only instead of hard corners, it had rounded corners. And it was large, far taller than she was. Was this where the Goddess would emerge? The Goddess would be quite large indeed.  She took several steps back and waited.

And wait she did. The knocking continued, the sounds of waves continued, but nothing happened. If anything, the waves started getting more intense. More continuous and louder. She eventually noticed there was something very similar to a lever next to the door. But it was not her place to pull it. Issa’Vala knew that you cannot hurry a hatchling. They hatch on their own time. The same must be true for Goddesses. She was busy committing everything to memory. This was truly a momentous occasion and she would tell this story for as long as she lived.

But did it truly have to take so long? Would it be considered disrespectful if she snuck a bite to eat? She supposed not. She reached into her satchel and started to eat some dried berries. The sounds of crashing waves stopped for just a moment, before getting even louder than ever before. She put her hands up to her ears before a searing pain struck her shoulder. She cried out as she was tackled to the ground.

“Haha, what have we here? A Plorian and some weird egg?” Said a gruff voice. A sharp pain was pressed into Issa’Vala’s back, keeping her pinned to the dirt. She recognized that language. As she looked back, her deepest fears were realized. She had beaten the Lokrans, but only just. They had arrived, and the Goddess still hadn’t hatched yet.

“Spread out women!” the gruff voice called out, coming from the hulking woman that had Issa’Vala pinned to the ground. “Surround this thing, whatever it is.”

Other soldiers appeared, soon surrounding the egg, all carrying crude axes and wooden spears. Of course they were barbarians, they barely had any clothing on. And the clothing they did have were barely treated animal leathers, with the heads still attached to the skin. Issa’Vala could feel her warm blood dripping down her shoulder, staining her white tunic a deep shade of blue.

“Tell me Plorian, what is this thing?”

“I not ‘Plorian.’ I am Issa’Vala,” Issa’Vala said through gritted teeth in a butchering of the Lokran language. She soon returned to her own language. “I am the Guardian of the Guardian Star. I will not let you harm it!”

“Ho ho! Did you say ‘Issa’?” The gruff woman soon laughed and called out to the other women. “Hey! We got royalty here!”

The woman all chortled, Issa’Vala’s mind was racing. How was she going to protect the egg when she was so vastly outnumbered?

“Sorry, your ‘highness’,” The gruff woman continued, this time in the Plorian language, much to Issa’Vala’s shock. “You underestimated us Lokrans. We learned. We have learned much of your culture and language and tactics. All so we could better eliminate you. You should have seen the bodies of your queen and your sister. They fell on their swords, their guts spilled wastefully on the ground for their failure of not being able to defeat the ‘barbaric’ Lokrans.”

The gruff woman laughed cruelly, along with the rest of her squadron. Her head tentacles were all spread out and unkempt, she was utterly in control and she knew it. Issa’Vala’s head tentacles were extending and spreading out as blind anger threatened to overtake her.

“Ah ah ah,” The gruff woman said as she grabbed one of Issa’Vala’s head tentacles and pulled incredibly hard, plucking it with ease as Issa’Vala roared in pain. Blood poured from her wound before what was left of her tentacle swelled shut, sealing the wound but the pain remained. “No resisting. Now, tell me what this metal thing is, before I pull out another one.”

Issa’Vala could feel her hearts beat rapidly. She wasn’t going to live through this for much longer, she was certain of that. But perhaps she could buy some time until the Goddess could hatch. As if to reassure her, the sounds of crashing waves echoed throughout the crater. “It...It is an egg. An egg that will hatch the Guardian Goddess of Ploria.”

“Goddess? Oh come off it.” The gruff woman replied as she did something that caused shooting pain in Issa’Vala’s shoulder. She cried out again, breathing rapidly and shallowly. She soon realized that the pain she felt earlier was because of an arrow, and the woman was diving it deeper into her. “You think this thing is a goddess? Your goddesses do not exist. If they do, they have forsaken you.”

“It is our goddess,” Issa’Vala responded breathlessly. “She will protect. She...will...defeat you…”

The gruff woman spat on her in the most barbaric way possible. She could feel the heat of the ink, the stickiness of it as it covered her head.

“Hey Chief!” one of the women soldiers called out in the Lokran language. “We found a lever or something the Plorians like to use to close their gates.”

“Pull it then. Perhaps this ‘goddess’ of theirs will come out and she can witness the death of one of their rulers. I bet a tenth of my share of the loot that it’s merely another Plorian all dressed up.”

Issa’Vala felt the woman get off her and grab her tunic. She was roughly forced to her knees, facing the doorway which she was sure the goddess would emerge from. This was it, they were forcing the hatching. Would the goddess be able to survive? Would it be as powerful as her people needed?

“Pull it now!” the Chief ordered.

One soldier pulled, but the lever did not budge. She called over another soldier and they both pulled, but still it would not budge. Grunting and groaning, they heaved until finally with a loud metallic clank, like a massive hammer striking an anvil, the lever moved. An incredibly loud hissing sound was heard as air washed all over them, spreading dirt every which way.

“Say ‘hello’ to your ‘goddess’.” the chief growled as Issa’Vala felt a sharp pain in her back that pierced through to her midsection that took the wind right out of her. She stared down in disbelief at the iron sword, stained with her bright blue blood, that had stabbed her straight through her second heart. The chief pulled her sword out and threw Issa’Vala to the ground. So this was to be her fate, a slow, painful death. Her first heart could continue her life for a short time, but she’d eventually bleed out. Perhaps she could see the Goddess before the depths claimed her.

The door did open of its own accord. What or who was opening it, Issa’Vala couldn’t see. Smoke or steam or something similar billowed out of the opening, obscuring her vision. She could hear it, however. It sounded like it was walking, and it sounded so very heavy. With each step it took, the ground trembled.

*“You know, I was having a nice, one sided conversation with this lady until you dumb fucks decided to torture and stab her right before my eyes. I have to say, that pissed me off. So imagine my delight when you idiots figured out how to pull a lever and inadvertently freed me.”*

There it was! The language of the goddesses! The heavenly language only written about in the sacred texts! Of course she had no idea what the words meant. But if she was being quite honest with herself, it was utterly eerie. It sounded like harsh barks and deep, guttural groans from another realm. If she weren’t already mortally wounded, she’d probably be running for her very life.

When the smoke cleared, there stood the goddess. She was unlike anything Issa’Vala had ever seen before in her life. She was fully metallic, shining a bright, brilliant crimson red. And so large, larger than even the largest woman she had ever laid eyes on. She must have been at least two heads taller than Issa’Vala herself. And Her head, it was otherworldly. Fully metallic, eyes that always looked like they were constantly furious, and a wide open mouth. Or at least, it had the appearance of being open, but it too was fully metallic. Issa’Vala was unsure how the goddess was able to speak. In a hazy thought, Issa’Vala thought that it looked like armor. But she mentally laughed at such a notion. After all why would a goddess need armor? Regardless, the metal goddess extended an arm towards Issa’Vala, pointing at her.

“*Don’t worry, I’ll protect you.”*

“Attac-!” The chief started to order before being interrupted. The goddess had already slammed Her fist into the soldier closest to the door. The soldier flew back forty feet before landing with a sickening thud. The soldier’s chest had collapsed from the blow as she desperately tried to suck in air that would never come.

The other soldier swung her axe at the goddess, who effortlessly caught it in Her hands. She grabbed the soldier’s arm and squeezed, causing the soldier to scream in agony as her arm was reduced to a mangled, shredded mess. Leaving the soldier, the goddess jumped, leaping up twenty-, no, thirty feet into the air, landing with a ground shaking quake right next to another soldier who let out a piercing war cry. The chief also let out a war cry as she led the Lokrans into battle.

The scene kept repeating itself again and again like a never ending nightmare. A soldier attacked with a spear that bounced harmlessly off the goddess. The goddess responded by ripping that soldier’s arms off. Another shot arrows at Her. She caught one mid flight and threw it, literally threw it back with such force that the soldier’s head was split in two. Blood stained the ground, spraying every which way from the force of the Goddess’ attacks. Some even sprayed all over Issa’Vala, but she was too delirious to notice. She was edging closer and closer to the Gate of Heaven.

Soon, all that was left was the chief, holding the iron sword still stained with Issa’Vala’s blood. Issa’Vala could barely see the two, such was her vision swimming and blurring. The chief swung her sword at the goddess, who caught it in Her hands and crushed it, splintering it into hundreds of shards.

“Impossible.” The chief said in utter disbelief, uttering her last words.

Before the chief could recover, the goddess grabbed her entire midsection and squeezed. The sickening crunch of breaking bones filled the air as blue blood sprayed every which way, staining the crimson metal of the goddess. Dropping the still twitching body into a heap on the floor, the goddess lifted up a large leg and stomped down, shaking up a huge cloud of dirt as the body was soon nothing more than shards of bone and fleshy pulp.

Issa’Vala could scarcely believe it. The falling star was indeed a goddess, come to save Ploria. As she lay there, motionless in a pool of her own blood, she tried to speak, but no words could come. Blood was filling her lungs, her time was almost up. She barely even noticed that her goddess was suddenly in front of her, peering down at her. No longer a bright crimson color, but rather a dull purple. So was the goddess birthed, in the blood of Lokrans.

“*You’re safe now.”*

With that, the goddess quickly moved back inside the metallic egg. Such a funny thing, really, the egg. Who knew that goddesses were born much the same way that Issa’Vala herself was born? The rumbling of the ground soon announced that the goddess was back.

*“Ah don’t worry, these should get you right back up in no time. Wait, wrong language. What was it again? Right, right.* Do not worry, you will not die this day.”

The last bit, she actually understood. Her goddess had deemed her worthy of hearing Her voice in her own language. What a wonderful last gift to send her off to the afterlife. She felt a small, piercing pain in her arm, but it seemed so very distant. And Issa’Vala was so very tired. She could rest now, right? The goddess was free, her people were safe.

And as darkness filled her vision, one last thought swam to the forefront of her mind. For a goddess who would be a protector and savior of her people, why did she have to be so utterly terrifying?

# What I love about the Stormlight Archives by Brandon Sanderson

* Unusual concepts weaved together in a unique and interesting fantasy world.
* Classic themes of the epic battle between good and evil served in a modern, non-simplistic way.
* A hopeful, rather than a cynical message.

Stormlight Archives is the most ambitious project of one of the most accomplished fantasy authors of our time. It enjoys astounding commercial success for a good reason. This doesn’t mean it’s a perfect match to everyone’s tastes, but there are gem(heart)s inside Stormlight that win a lot of people over.

Below I’ll try to single out those gems, while at the same time exploring what pushes some people away from this epic fantasy classic-in-the-making.

https://preview.redd.it/a8tv24bf09951.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ee360191f4db83793334f6fd80f8b2db58297799

# Stormlight’s Plot: slow buildups, great payoffs

I am a grown-ass man. I was raised by my father to never show weakness, to take life one punch at a time, to keep my chin up (to bottle-up my emotions, to be inadequate at expressing them… the whole shebang.). I rarely cry.

Yet, close to the conclusion of The Way of Kings, I shed a few manly tears. And not because something tragic happened. On the contrary — because something beautiful happened.

I don’t expect everyone to be hit by the payoff of that exact book so profoundly. Yet, I’m sure there are moments in the series that would drop your jaw. One of Brandon’s greatest strengths by far is **intentionally building up the story to an amazing peak and resolution**. I haven’t read other authors who manage to pull it off so consistently.

A great payoff requires you to be very engaged in the story, and a high-level of engagement doesn’t come for free, however.

**> Common criticism: bloat**

The first installment, The Way of Kings, is 400k words. This is more than some whole book series. And the Way of Kings isn’t even the thickest Stormlight book.

Needless to say, the story doesn’t move at a break-neck pace. The books take their time to introduce plenty of character background information (whole chapters), as well as plenty of world-building (sometimes introduced through a lot of secondary characters with their mini-storylines).

The drawback of all these non-essential elements is that some of the things you read about feel unconnected to the main story and as a result — pointless. Even I, as a big fan of the series, have found myself wanting to skip ahead to find out what “actually” happens with the characters that “actually” matter.

Because of this, some readers might find Stormlight inferior to some of Sanderson’s tighter, less world-building-indulgent pieces of fiction (Warbreaker, Emperor’s Soul, etc.). We’ve all heard variations of the thought “life is too short to waste time on books you don’t enjoy”. Stormlight books can certainly take up a lot of your time, which means the bar they need to cross to be worth your while is a lot higher.

The benefit is that this way of writing increases your understanding — of the world and the conflicts in it, as well as the characters and their motivation. You become more and more invested and slowly you start to care a great deal. When the plot twists, unexpected things are revealed. When the conflict peaks, it hits you hard.

For me, the impact of the payoff more than justifies the lengthy buildup. Few authors can make this grown-ass reader cry while simultaneously putting a huge grin on his face.

# Stormlight’s Setting: unique, systematic, conceptual

Usually, a fantasy setting is based on a specific period in human history. To make it unique, fantasy authors add their own pinch of mythology, magic, made-up cultures, nations, history, etc.

https://preview.redd.it/kubqtw1l09951.jpg?width=2628&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6c1a30b1c77ad3821ea79e8f033c353e46139c72

In contrast, sci-fi authors often build their world on top of specific (scientific) premises: *what if X, Y, and Z are true in the future?* How would this affect the world, humanity, and individual people?

Instead of largely basing his world on a historic setting, it seems Brandon builds Roshar using some “what if” premises, not unlike a sci-fi author.

* *What if the planet was ravaged by cyclical, super-powerful storms? How would this change the natural world (ecology)? How would it change architecture, culture, etc.?*
* *What if society discriminates based on eye color? What if the gender stereotypes were strong enough to force men and women into vastly different, albeit equally important roles: women being scholars, men being warriors?*
* *How would the economy be different if the magic system was able to provide food, weapons, building materials, and other essentials?*

This approach to worldbuilding makes his world very understandable and digestible on a rational, cause-consequence level.

\> **Common criticism: a sense of hollowness**

Yet, every coin has two sides. The benefit of Sanderson’s approach to worldbuilding is that he can create a world unusually rich in unique and interesting concepts. The drawback is that the level of unfamiliarity means it takes a lot of effort to fully immerse the reader into the world. It requires a lot of words to weave all of these concepts into the story. Building understanding is one thing, but nurturing a feeling of a living, breathing world takes a lot of time.

If you are cynical, you could argue that the world of a Song of Ice and Fire (and Game of Thrones) is simply medieval Britain with a pinch of dragons, zombies, and the occasional foreign culture. Not a lot of unique concepts there, comparatively. Yet, the Seven Kingdoms feel much more like a living, breathing world to a lot of readers.

Why is that?

**Realistic vs romantic:** Тhe writing style of Martin helps. He presents his world in a gritty, cynical, hyper-realistic way. Sanderson presents humanity in a cleaner, idealistic, romantic way. This might contribute to the feeling of “unrealness” of his world. *(There are positives to this writing style, but more on that below.)*

**Prior knowledge:** Moreover, when you think about it, it is not that surprising that a fantasy world based on the real world feels more real than a fantasy world based on new imaginary concepts. A (western) reader has had their whole life building some understanding of medieval Europe. It’s very easy to project that understanding onto the Seven Kingdoms. It’s harder to project it directly onto Roshar.

Roshar is more conceptual. More intriguing, maybe, but besides the few areas in which most of the story takes place (the Shattered Plains and later on — Urithiru), the rest of the world feels a bit theoretical and inconsequential. Do real people even live there?

Yet, I have confidence that as the series progress, this feeling will diminish. The rest of Roshar will get populate with living and breathing people and cultures as Sanderson continues taking us to different parts of his world. There are, after all, ten books planned to take place on Roshar, and currently, only three are published (soon to be four). I believe Oathbringer displays a trend in this direction.

**> Details & Systems**

It’s not a secret Brandon Sanderson is a lover of well-defined hard magic systems. Stormlight’s Surgebinding is not an exception, but in tone with the whole series — it’s a tad more ambitious in terms of scope. It consists of ten Surges (powers). Each magic user utilizes two. This means that mathematically there are 45 different types of Surgebinders. Of course, the story doesn’t concern itself with all of them.

Yet.

https://preview.redd.it/6fpgf1gq09951.jpg?width=1723&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8eef775dc2d7f300d5b1116e0746a309320905d

That said, Brandon is definitely a lover of systems in general. If you have alcoholic beverages in your fantasy world, why not have a system on the subject?

https://preview.redd.it/bq2zitsr09951.jpg?width=1627&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b802b3974b4cfa5c6eaf840a121170253f25af55

The Vorin wines could easily be substituted with normal alcohol and this would probably have shortened the book some thousand words. Yet, would this make the books better or worse? For some readers, getting to what’s important (characters, plot) is what counts, and a thing as “pointless” as a system of wines is a con.

For others, details like these are why they enjoy fantasy and sci-fi worldbuilding in the first place.

Sanderson indulges in such details. If you enjoy getting to know a different world, you’ll probably enjoy Stormlight. If the Vorin wines system seems pointless to you, you might find some parts of the books frustrating.

# Stormlight’s Characters: the goal is inspiration, not grotesque realism

Characters are where Stormlight (and Brandon Sanderson as a whole) receives its harshest criticism. However, I believe this is more of a display of different expectations and tastes among readers rather than a reflection of Brandon’s inability to write interesting characters.

[Shallan at the Shattered Plains illustrated by Michael Whelan: https:\/\/www.michaelwhelan.com\/](https://preview.redd.it/mfdcx4mt09951.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=200ce7d79809ccec8d0a9f6341bec7afbcdab571)

Real people are extremely complex.

Any character in a piece of fiction is a construct that attempts to deceive you that you are reading about a real person. Perfect photorealism, however, isn’t what most authors are aiming at. Characters are an abstraction, and the author usually emphasizes certain characteristics and downplays others to build a character that fits their narrative, theme, writing style, etc.

* If you are writing something grimdark, most of your protagonists are likely to be cynical and violent (or naïve, and they pay for it). Probably more so than most real humans. And they inhabit a world that reflects their nature.
* If you are writing a classic good vs evil (hero vs dragon) story, your protagonists are likely to have a very fine-tuned moral compass no matter how dark and edgy they claim to be. And they inhabit a world where good and bad are easily distinguishable.

This doesn’t mean one type of character is inferior to the other. Both could be interesting if done well. There is an audience for both styles — sometimes overlapping, but sometimes not. I believe the non-overlapping part of the audience is where most criticism is coming from.

**> Clean & naïve vs gritty & cynical**

Brandon himself said that when he was trying to get published for the first time, the big fantasy publishers were looking for the next Martin or Abercrombie. He tried to write in a similar grimdark style, but it didn’t turn out well. So, he returned to what comes naturally to him.

Yes, his romance is entirely PG13. Yes, even his “broken” protagonists are entirely redeemable and morally light-gray at best. The evil they are facing comes either from a source outside of humanity or from obviously morally inferior people.

Yet, this has a purpose. **Stormlight’s message is one of hope.**

The protagonists come from a place of ruin and walk a path of redemption and growth. The process of gradually incorporating the different ancient ideals of the Knights Radiant makes this growth very deliberate.

>*″‘You want too much of me’ he snapped at her as he reached the other side of the chasm. ‘I’m not some glorious knight of ancient days. I’m a broken man. Do you hear me Syl? I’m broken.’*  
>  
>*She zipped up to him and whispered ‘That’s what they all were, silly.‘”*

Brandon Sanderson doesn’t have a cynical bone in his body, and this is perfectly fine. Some stories and characters are meant to inspire, rather than delve into the grotesque parts of humanity.

*Personal worry: power creepBrandon’s protagonists tend to grow in power considerably as the story progresses (think superhero origin stories). This means that while they grow more awesome, they also become a bit less relatable. I believe this is one of the reasons I enjoyed the first book the most. It makes me slightly worried where things will stand in book five/ten, but let’s hope Rhythm of War will ease my concerns!*

# Sanderson’s Prose: a tool, rather than an end in itself

Sanderson explains it pretty well himself:

The prose is the window through which the reader views the story. The window could be a piece of art itself (stained glass), or it could be functional (clear glass). Sanderson certainly leans towards the clear glass prose style.

This doesn’t mean his prose is bad. On the contrary — he can make you laugh, cry, and turn the pages. Also, you will rarely be confused, if ever.

It just means that you won’t often find yourself stopping to admire the exact string of words he’s using, which could be a minus if that’s what you’re into. The meaning of his words, however, is something you’ll admire often:

>*“And so, does the destination matter? Or is it the path we take? I declare that no accomplishment has substance nearly as great as the road used to achieve it. We are not creatures of destinations. It is the journey that shapes us. Our callused feet, our backs strong from carrying the weight of our travels, our eyes open with the fresh delight of experiences lived. In the end, I must proclaim that no good can be achieved by false means. For the substance of our existence is not in the achievement, but in the method.”*

# The Way of Kings, Words of Radiance, & Oathbringer mini-reviews

I’ve kept these minimalistic because the purpose of this Stormlight review is to speak about the series in general rather than compare the individual books in it. Nonetheless, here are my quick impressions:

\> **The Way of Kings:**

Each book focuses heavily on one of the protagonists and provides retrospective chapters that tell their backstory. The first book focuses on Kaladin’s story, and from my prior confession of shedding a tear, you might have guessed it’s my favorite.

The main theme is his struggle to incorporate the first Knights Radiant ideal.

* *Life before death:* dealing with his depression and choosing to live despite the place he finds himself in.
* *Strength before weakness:* succeeding when everything is stacked against him.
* *Journey before destination:* learning to value the final goal less than the way you reach it.

**> Words of Radiance:**

The second book focuses on Shallan and provides her backstory. I’ve heard many people claim this is their favorite entry, and I can easily see some readers (especially women) being moved by Shallan’s story as strongly as I was moved by Kaladin’s.

Sometimes when male authors decide to write a badass female protagonist, they inevitably create a Red Sonja — even though she is female, what makes her badass are archetypally male characteristics. Shallan, however, is a strong female character while remaining very feminine, which is great. (This is true about all three major female characters in Stormlight.)

\> **Oathbringer:**

Probably the entry that suffers the most from the bloat problem. At the same time, it provides the biggest leap forward in terms of worldbuilding and making Roshar more tangible. I suspect the two (bloat and worldbuilding) are somewhat connected. It focuses on Dalinar and his struggle to lead while dealing with his past transgressions. The book was probably my least favorite, but I’m sure there are plenty of people who would disagree. (Conspiracy theory: Dalinar, the Wise King archetype, the Mufasa of Stormlight, needs to die to raise the stakes in books four and five.)

# Final Remarks:

Brandon Sanderson is continuing the classic epic fantasy tradition of Tolkien and Jordan rather than the modern grimdark branch of authors like Martin and Abercrombie.

If you strongly prefer the latter, you’ll probably find Stormlight Archives terribly overhyped.

If you enjoy the former, you might have found your new favorite series and a profound source of inspiration.

**Earth Space Union’s Prisoner Asset Files: #1284 - Private Capal** 

*Loading Derandi Battle.Txt…*

I found the history of humankind to be a source of complete and utter fascination for me. Earth had once had its monarchs and empires, just as we had, but had emerged with democratic states like the Derandi and Girret. The humans were in the process of coalescing into larger regional territories, a sociological phenomenon known to Vascar scholars as *Pan-nationalgenesis.* 

In Vascar society, regional unification was seen in the form of Larimak’s family clamping down their control. On Earth, it began the moment it was confirmed that the *Voyager* probes had crashed into an invisible barrier. That was a matter of great confusion and fear for the locals. It birthed a religious renaissance (and the birth of new faith called Captivism), and was a unifying factor for their species. Most of all, it kindled an insatiable desire to understand the barrier.

There were many historical chapters before that of great interest, of course. The humans circumnavigated their world despite extraordinary challenges, in ships that moved at little more than *walking speed of* 5 miles per hour. Their drive to explore and willingness to risk-take blew me away, though at that time, their “champions” had landed on foreign shores with much less beneficence than we saw in the modern era. The Derandi didn’t need to hear tales of barbarism in Sol, but I understood that history was often…grisly, and that morality often followed a planet’s greater education and unification. Ethics were born in times of opulence and luxury, which was a sad commentary.

*And not true of our modern monarchy. Larimak and his ilk kept the greatest wealth of our society for themselves, and maintained enough of a claw in the educational system to ensure that our fealty is to him. That’s the philosophy they perpetuate.*

With our past and present, I wasn’t one to cast aspersions on modern humans for past transgressions; I was more interested in cataloging the unique effects of Sol physics on societal development. Vascar had a Colonialist Era as well, with the great kingdoms often arriving by torching shorelines. However, with the higher output of force in our universe, we could power our early ships with hand paddling or cranks, and surpass the humans’ speeds—even before the advent of steam power. The ocean wasn’t a place that ever took months or years to cross, nor was space. 

It was different for the humans. Yet naval traditions and far-flung civilizations went back millenia: from Athenian triremes that used 170 oarsmen and sails to move at crawling speeds, to the trading hub of Punt visited by the famed Egyptians nearly two thousand years prior. There was something in those texts, between the lines; there was an innate desire for humans to connect with other lands and societies, to travel to far-off places. Fast forward to the birth of their space program, the famous words of a long-deceased leader encapsulated their omnipresent mentality.

“We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.”

For humans, that microscopic foray off of their own world was a chasm away: it was a “giant leap” for their species. What, then, would crossing The Gap mean to the future generations? I saw a connection between that first achievement, and this one that unlocked infinitely larger possibilities. Mankind broke through the barrier *because it was hard,* and discovering the Elusians’ motives was just their next mountain to climb. Everything had always been impossible for humans, so why would an empire which was impossible to hold a candle to deter them?

“That’s a rousing speech and all, but I don’t see how this answers my question about what’s so great about history?” Dawson prodded.

I pressed an embarrassed paw to my snout. “Sorry. I got carried away. My point is that…the story of your people has been consistent. It’s what makes you who you are. Whatever the Elusians’ motives are: to protect you from us or us from you, maybe to give you a nudge to enter the portal for some reason—perhaps knowing you can—it doesn’t much matter. I know by looking at your past that you will go to them in time.”

“You’re not the one who can see the future.”

“Your mistake is thinking the past and the future are all that different. Progress is the difference, but people—people are fundamentally the same throughout history. That’s what’s great about it: we’re looking at all that’s left of societies that thought themselves the apex of civilization, just like us, but in the end, they rose and fell. We have only the few monuments they left behind by which to judge them: only a few names that *mattered* enough to be etched into the collective consciousness. What I love about history is finding meaning in that.”

“But why?! You just said we’re all irrelevant, that most of us will fade into obscurity—”

“For us specifically, no. We have the rare, fleeting opportunity to shape history; that’s why I want to be here! Think how Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin are remembered on Earth. Sofia Aguado and Preston Carter will be infinitely more significant on many worlds. We are involved with important events and people right now, and we have the further blessing of *knowing* that we’re in the middle of making history. We can be *remembered*.”

Dawson’s expression was disgruntled. “I don’t see what I should care about being remembered, if I’m already dead.”

“You don’t want to leave a legacy for the future?! Ugh, forget I said anything. Humor my curiosity instead: what did you think about having an…invisible wall around your star system, before you knew of The Gap or ‘Caelum?’”

“It reminded me of hitting an invisible wall in a video game, and the way it reminds you of the artificiality of that world. It’s out of bounds, where the devs haven’t placed any assets. I was in the camp, ‘The universe is a simulation.’ Dr. Novikov herself was a disciple of the theory, in her last days. I’m not a smart guy, but big-brained people thought it proved some kind of design.” 

“That’s curious. Why would you favor that theory?”

“I liked it better than the idea that aliens…just didn’t want us to ever visit them. Finding that out scares me shitless, to be honest. The barrier is going to do *something*, sooner or later, and I fear punishment is coming. Maybe our overlords were onto something, that it was easier inside our bubble—easier where reality wasn’t such a mess.”

I tilted my head, squinting my eyes at him. “You said the barrier’s going to do something, as a statement of fact. Have you been having more visions?”

“Fragments of the same one. Scientists on Pluto Station, sending a message to us. They’re freaking out about some…massive pulses from the barrier with crazy readings. *Negative energy,* they keep saying. I looked it up—that’s theoretically what’s needed to keep something like The Gap open. What if the Elusians are blowing up the portal, or it’s some kind of warning shot, or it tears apart our whole dimension? I see it every night. I’m scared, Capal.”

“If you’re sure about the terms you used, you just discovered the nature of the barrier. That’s good; your scientists can use that. People can prepare and evacuate away from at least the outer planets, because of you. I’ll help you, okay?”

The human offered a shaky nod, before checking his wrist display in search of a distraction. His eyes stretched wide at a base-wide alert, and he tapped on a video included in a moment. I listened carefully to the opening words, hearing the immediate declaration that Larimak’s fleet had attacked Temura. Dawson seemed nervous about the outcome, so I took that as a sign that he’d hold up better with me reviewing the events with him. I wondered if this war against Larimak would be what drew the Elusians’ attention, and presumably cause them to activate the barrier.

I was rooting for the downfall of the tyrannical prince, despite the fact that I’d been forced to fight at his side myself a few weeks prior back on Jorlen; these weren’t my people, not anymore. The human ships were mobilizing to meet the incursion, judging by the markers on the screen. Various feeds looped through, with different vantage points from ESU hulls. I wasn’t one to touch on the nitty-gritty details of technology, but broad strokes and wider implications were up my alley. What I noticed immediately was that the Sol vessels’ guns fired on a single vector—relying on pinpoint accuracy.

*That* element wasn’t tailored to our physics, where such precision was a laughable idea. All of our spaceships’ broadside guns would fire together to form a spread out cone—scattershot munitions—in the hopes of hitting a general *area* specified by artificial intelligence.

“Not even Mikri could calculate a single point where an enemy ship would be here! They’re moving too fast and shifting their path constantly, so it’s not just simple orbital mechanics,” I remarked. “It’s not like Jorlen, where the ships and platforms were in a stationary, defensive position; they’re moving trillions of miles an hour, Dawson. The entire way you build your weapons doesn’t work at these speeds.”

Dawson held his head in his hands. “You’re saying we wouldn’t be able to hit the side of a barn?”

“Maybe you…have other things in mind. Surely the Serv—your mechanical friends have told you this.”

“The AI Vascar told us about orbital defense platforms and stopping high-speed objects. We’ve been using that knowledge to buff the Space Gate; that was our primary concern. We have a limited number of ships, and no way to build new ones over here.”

“You have robotic factories on Kalka, and the AIs could help you mass produce ships! It won’t be Sol materials, but it’s better than not having ships.”

“We wouldn’t have enough humans to fly them; we don’t have that many people close to the Gap, Capal! It’s better that the AI Vascar support us, but they sure as shit won’t get involved to defend Temura. Mikri is about the *only* android keen on reaching out to Alliance factions.”

*This is not good. Better my dimension-hopper friends learn this lesson now, rather than when my people are coming for the Space Gate. The humans have no viable options to defend the Derandi, and Larimak is barreling into the system. Let’s hope the birds can take matters into their own wings.*

It wasn’t long before the humans realized that their onboard AI couldn’t get a lock on ships that went so mind-bendingly fast. Perhaps this was one area that had been much easier for them before switching to our dimension. Larimak’s weapons were of immediate efficacy, with their broad areas of impact; orange rays barreled into Sol metal, which had the saving grace of being more resilient…but not *that* resilient. Direct hits dealt major, often catastrophic, damage to ESU vessels.

The dimension-hoppers got the message to stay on the move themselves, to avoid being easy targets. Adding in the humans’ own blazing speeds made the AI’s task even harder. Unable to touch Larimak’s ships, the defensive effort must’ve been a great disappointment to the Derandi; the munitions could be the most powerful of any in Caelum, but if they couldn’t connect, it didn’t matter. I listened to the bridge chatter, and eventually realized…

“Arcing the nose down two degrees!” a navigations’ officer on the *ESU Cleaver* shouted, already having completed the action. Had the vessel stayed on its previous trajectory, it would’ve taken two hits from one of Larimak’s “Fireball” rounds; instead, it ducked just beneath it. 

The feed switched over to the *ESU Pirouette.* “I have a bad feeling about this zigzag maneuver, sir. Looping…feels better.”

“What the fuck are you talking about, Rinaldo?” the superior officer returned.

The technician hesitated, before inputting her own flight data. “We die if we zigzag. I…felt myself die, felt a coldness on my hand as it moved toward the screen. I’m sorry, sir.”

Similar stories were shared from across the human fleet, as many seemed to get some intangible notification if they were about to be hit. Being able to predict an incoming attack didn’t *always* mean that end could be avoided; still, being able to detect and predict incoming shots, when they couldn’t be seen with the naked eye or instruments until *after* they’d arrived—it was a major boon.

“ESU officers, please be advised that bridge crew have been able to predict the paths of enemy munitions through untested precognitive abilities,” a human fleet admiral stated, somehow speaking this in the calm, matter-of-fact manner of any other internal chatter. “Advise your navigations’ crew to heed any odd feelings and intuition; it seems combat makes it much easier to tap into these abilities, using this unobtrusive method. Also…order your weapons officers to manually target the Vascar ships, and to rely on their gut instincts.”

The same captain who’d chastised Rinaldo drew a sharp breath. “I’m asking you to repeat that order, ma’am. Did I just hear you say to let our weapons officers *feel* out enemy ships?”

“It is a rather strange directive, but yes, that’s our plan of action. Given that we cannot hit the vessels otherwise, it is worth an attempt.”

I was watching on the edge of my seat, unable to believe that even humanity’s future vision would allow them to nail down the exact position of a ship moving at those speeds. Railguns and Sol lasers alike *would* be devastating, especially with just how fast and hard the former’s bullets—also made of sterner materials—could be fired. Was it madness that part of me just wanted to believe this strategy would work? If they could guess where hostile ships were with any accuracy, with greater success rates than Larimak, it was a decisive game-changer!

The humans would have superior technology that no other race could replicate, fueled by magic targeting. My claws curled with anticipation as they fired off the first volleys with the new orders; the vast majority were shockingly close, but a hair off. Then again, the dimension-hoppers were getting a feel for their abilities. These results were better than the prior methodology. A few hostiles were taken out, giving the ESU their first kills—and an actual fighting chance.

“That worked,” I breathed. “You can actually do future prediction real-time, on command, for practical applications. Do you realize what this means?”

Dawson scrunched his nose. “We’re psychic? We can see attacks coming?”

“Well, yes. If you fully master it, you could pen a new relationship with *time.* You might learn to constantly see what will happen before it happens in real time: double sight. Look at this! You’re taking to it so naturally, as though you were always meant to.”

Over time, the precision of the shots narrowed in on the intended targets. Some human gunners had more of a knack for precognition than others, as if they could sync with one hostile ship at a time and follow it to its destination. There was no fooling an adversary who knew what you were going to do before the thought ever crossed your brain. The ESU hadn’t even uncorked their monstrous explosives yet, but vicious lasers could incinerate hulls with ease; any detonation from a Sol yield was going to be astronomical, consuming everything in its wake. 

Even bullets hit with so much power, spit out with such force from the railguns, that the kinetics were like miniature missiles of their own. If humans didn’t need to worry about predicting where the enemy would be through natural means, then their weapons might not need an overhaul at all. The Derandi’s salvation seemed to be that the prince’s forces couldn’t get through, even at speeds where they should’ve been untouchable. Larimak was a *madman* to tussle with gods; had Vascarkind met these people before we knew the word “dimension,” we would’ve bowed before them.

After the nebula and an incursion force that had almost been blown to smithereens, I wasn’t worried about the Vascar Monarchy as a true challenger to humanity. Larimak had limited forces at his disposal, and the ESU had given the Derandi a convincing showing that they could protect Temura. I felt confident this invasion would be mopped up within minutes. The Elusians were the true threat; no amount of foresight could counteract their otherworldly technology. 

The activation of the barrier around the Sol system was what I thought the dimension-hoppers should worry about. The bubble that gave humanity their unimaginable strength was too easy to pop, for an empire that could manipulate the fifth dimension at will. I hoped the war with my people could come to an end too, before the Earthlings attracted the attention of beings far beyond their level.

2024-08-07 19:42:39,"Yes, homosexual acts are sinful: A Thorough Look # INTRO

**EDIT:** I have been editing this post periodically to make it easier to read and digest. I hope you will find that helpful.

At least 10+ times a day people ask on r/Christianity  ""are homosexual acts sinful?"" or some variation of that. These posts ALWAYS get the most comments out of any other post in this sub reddit, often times by non-Christians that seek to put their morality onto Christians. So I wanted to post this and cover the gambit of arguments people make for and against homosexual acts. Part of the reason is that I hope this post can be used by Christians to respond to those who continually ask (because I also noticed that many responses from Christians are lacking **severely** in theological knowledge or understanding).

I am bound to miss some things, so feel free to include areas of argumentation I might have missed in the comments. Likewise, feel free to attack any of the claims I make. However, if you are going to attack my claims, it must be from a Scriptural basis. Simply saying ""well we just need to love people"" or ""well actually you are wrong"" without pointing to any sort of evidence are NOT sufficient arguments.

**Also, be sure to read the ENTIRE post before writing your arguments**. You will find I repeat some things, or address some arguments later in the post, so this is to save you from writing a lot and then realizing I addressed it later in the post.

Also, a note to the affirming Christians here: I understand you have your reasons for believing the way you do. I notice it usually comes from a few places.

1. You may not care (or know) what Scripture says regarding homosexual acts, and base your theology on what makes people the most happy or what is ""loving"" to others.
2. You reject Paul and the Apostles words as authoritative, and only focus on the words of Jesus who never directly talks about homosexual acts.
3. You reject traditional Biblical theology and appeal to the culture of the time over the words within Scripture.
4. You theologically believe that the Bible is affirming of monogamous same-sex marriages. **I hope to address all of these issues here as well.**

I will touch on some of those reasons near the end of this post.

Also, before I jump in I want to clarify here the difference between homosexual desires or temptations and homosexual acts. It is quite simple.  
**- Homosexual acts or lust = sinful**  
**- Homosexual desires or temptation = not sinful**  
Everyone faces some degree of sexual temptation, no matter whom they are attracted to. Dwelling on immoral sexual thoughts or acting on immoral sexual impulses is sin. Intentionally seeking out situations which are likely to be tempting is also inappropriate for the Christian. Simply having those temptations or desires is not sin.

I will be pulling from the NIV version, the ESV Study Bible, [Blue Letter Bible](http://blueletterbible.org/), [Reformation Project](http://reformationproject.org/) (for the affirming argument), Dr. Preston Sprinkle, and various other websites that I will try to remember to link when used for my information. I hope you will see it is well researched and Biblically sound. (But I am by no means a scholar, don't claim to be, and likely will get some things wrong).

Lastly, I want to remember the words of Galatians 6:2 that say ""**carry each other's burdens, and in that way you will fulfill the law of Christ.**"" Let us be respectful and loving, carrying each other's burdens no matter how difficult so that we might fulfill the Law of Christ.

# BODY (PART 1)

Now I want to first look at what the Bible says, and some of the arguments for and against. The verses I will be looking at primarily are **Leviticus 18:22 & 20:13, Romans 1:26-27, 1 Corinthians 6:9, and 1 Timothy 1:8-10**.

>**Leviticus** [18:22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+18%3A22&version=NIV) **&** [20:13](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+20%3A13&version=NIV) - ""Do not have sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman; that is detestable"" & ""If a man has sexual relations with a man as one does with a woman, both of them have done what is detestable. They are to be put to death; their blood will be on their own heads.""

We see here that the Bible is clearly and unequivocally saying homosexual acts are sinful, and that the penalty is death. Case closed right? Well, there is one problem with Christians using these verses to show that homosexual acts are sinful. **Christians aren't under the Mosaic Law anymore.** The Law of Moses was fulfilled by Christ on the cross, and is no longer in effect (Galatians 3:24-25). So every single time you, as a Christian, use these verses to prove that homosexual acts are sinful, you are performing (in my opinion) **questionable** [exegesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exegesis). I believe that these verses are not the ones you should be referring to in order to prove your point.

Of course, it is important to also point out that there is differing Christian thought in regards to if certain commands in Leviticus 18 - 20 are **still** authoritative for us today. I don't want to get into that argumentation on this post but [here](https://bibleproject.com/podcast/which-laws-still-apply/), [here](https://www.olivetree.com/blog/old_testament_law_still_apply/), and [here](https://www.gotquestions.org/Christian-law.html) are helpful articles that go into more detail for those who aren't familiar with this type of theology. If one believes that laws related to homosexual acts in chapters 18 - 20 are still authoritative to us today, then that is basically end of the argument. The verses are very conclusive and even an affirming Christian wouldn't be able to argue against them (**affirming Christians hold the stance that they aren't authoritative anymore**). I encourage you to research those chapters and figure out where you fall on the issue. As I stated, I don't personally believe they are authoritative for us anymore, but that any laws mentioned again in the New Testament reaffirms the authoritativeness of those OT laws.

I want to clarify as well that I am not saying we should throw away or abolish the OT Law. I do not believe that at all, because obviously we see Jesus and the Apostles quote the OT and they aren't committing ""questionable"" exegesis as mentioned above. However, I do think there is a difference between Jesus and the Apostles using the OT Law against Jewish people in their time vs. Christians using the OT Law against people today. Still I want to affirm that the OT Law has not been abolished, but fulfilled, and the OT Law still has uses such as helping to lead people to the Grace of Jesus (Galatians 3:4). Lastly, there are Christians who say we are still required to follow the entire Mosaic Law. **You are wrong**. We are not. This post isn't about that, but you can read more [here](https://www.gotquestions.org/Christian-law.html) (this article is the same as the one posted above).

>[**Romans 1:26-27**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+1%3A26-27&version=NIV) - ""Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their woman exchange natural sexual relations for unnatural ones. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed shameful acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their error.""

**Context:** 

The context of these verses is Paul talking about how the righteousness of God is being revealed through his wrath, since **all** have sinned against God. It is important to recognize that he is talking about the present reality, not the past, even if he might be using hyperbole. Of course, Paul is sure to mention that we are forgiven of our sins if we are in Christ, but that we must turn away from our sins. In verse 21 we see that the root sin is the failure to value God above all other things, and in verse 23 we see that idolatry is the fundamental sin that results from that. Because of people's idolatry ""[God gave them over](https://www.gotquestions.org/God-gave-them-over.html)"" to their sins which is where 26-27 picks up. The contrast we see in these verses is that just like how idolatry is unnatural, so to are homosexual acts and lust.

**Traditional View:** 

In these verses we see Paul confirming that homosexual acts are sinful. We also see that not SIMPLY homosexual acts, but **ALSO** such passions and desires are dishonorable to God. Now you may be saying, didn't I say above that desires weren't sinful? And also, where does it even say that in the text? Yes I did, and good question! The word it is using in the verse is ""lust"" but technically ""desire"" is a more accurate translation. However, the word ""desire"" in the original language is ""orexis"" which means ""longing"" or ""craving for."" It isn't just ""oh I find the same sex attractive"" like we may think desire to be in our culture. **Lust is simply the most accurate way to communicate that.** So we see that it is saying that people were exchanging normal sexual desires (a woman with a man) for unnatural ones (a woman with a woman) because God gave them up to their lusts. **This part is critical to understanding the verse**. It isn't just talking about homosexual lust, as some might say, but the nature of physical relationships themselves. Idolatry is the initial sin, but the result of that is **more** sin, because God gave them over. We see this when it says they received ""due penalty for their error"" which could refer to the sin of homosexuality itself, as a result of idolatry and lust, or some additional consequence that isn't named here. However, there is no doubt by the language used here and the original text that the act of lusting **AND** the act of homosexuality itself is considered sinful here.

I believe it is also useful here to discuss the words ""natural"" and ""unnatural"" in the above verses. The word ""natural"" in the original Greek is ""[physikos](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5446/esv/mgnt/0-1/)"" which can mean something produced by nature, agreeable to nature, or governed by (the instincts of) nature. The common definition accepted with the word used in Romans is ""agreeable to nature"" which is Paul saying that heterosexual sex is what is the natural (agreeable) position, and therefore, anything outside of that would be not agreeable to nature. Of course, someone might argue that the ""natural"" referred to here is monogamous relationships, and non-monogamous relationships are the unnatural, but that line of argument doesn't hold when you know the culture behind monogamous and non-monogamous relationships during that time, which I go into more detail later in this post. I also discuss more below regarding the word unnatural right below this. **For more details regarding Romans**, I highly recommend reading what Preston Sprinkle has written on the topic [here](https://theologyintheraw.com/the-sin-of-homosexuality/) (I used a good bit of his article to create this post).

**Affirming View:** 

The common affirming rebuttal here is that this verse is only talking about ""lusting"" but not sexual orientation. Of course, that view is simply incorrect when understanding the Scriptures. First, the wording doesn't support that claim at all. If the issue was simply lust, then there would be no reason to include specific sexual preferences. Some commentators say that in the ancient world it was assumed people could be satisfied with heterosexual sex, and to go beyond was due to insatiable lust. However, we know that Paul was also against heterosexual sex if it was outside the confines of marriage. Therefore, it makes no sense for him only to go after non-marital homosexual sex and leave out heterosexual sex. Since Paul is clearly making a distinction by specifically mentioning homosexual sex, we have to assume he is talking about those acts on top of the lust itself.

People may also want to point out that the words Paul uses in Romans ([physis](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g5449/esv/mgnt/0-1/)) are also the same words he uses when talking about hair length for Christians, and Paul's words regarding hair length are opinions not authoritative. That is true. Paul isn't making an authoritative claim when discussing hair length, but to say ""the words are the same, therefore it means the same"" is very dishonest. Words can have more than 1 meaning. In this case, we need to primarily look at the word ([atimia](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lexicon/g819/kjv/mgnt/0-1/)) which is translated into ""disgrace"" or ""vile"" in English. The Romans meaning of that word could accurately be described as ""base lusts or vile passions"" while the Corinthian meaning of that word could accurately be described as ""dishonor."" That aligns with our understanding of the word physis because the word in Romans would be accurately described as ""against nature"" while the word in Corinthians would be accurately described as ""against natural sense or conviction."" One (Romans) is discussing what is contrary to the plan of nature (what is abnormal and perverse), while the other (Corinthians) is a natural conviction or knowledge that one should know.

Lastly, there are some who believe that Romans 1:26b doesn't mean females who have sex with females. One such article can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1z8y0ByWzZDl5GsQS8iwl80h4bV2KvAYI/view?usp=drivesdk). (*It is important to mention that I can't find much about the author of the article, their credentials, or if they are even a Christian or not*). The author claims that Romans 1:26b is really talking about females who engage in non-procreative (non-vaginal) sex with men, and that it has been misunderstood. I have a few problems with the article (and don't think it changes anything about my argument) which I will explain below.

>[**1 Corinthians 6:9**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%206%3A9-11&version=NIV) **&** [**1 Timothy 1:10**](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Tim+1%3A8-10&version=NIV) - ""Or do you not know that wrongdoers will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor men who have sex with men"" & ""for the sexually immoral, for those practicing homosexuality, for slave traders and liars and perjurers - and for whatever else is contrary to the sound doctrine.

**Context:** 

In 1 Tim 1:10, we see that the context is Paul writing to Timothy, his disciple. He is telling Timothy that he can tell people what they are teaching is false doctrine and to stop, since they don't know what they are talking about. He says they want to be teachers of the law, and that the law exists for rule breakers such as those mentioned in the verse above. We see here that the law being discussed is the New Law through Jesus Christ, not the Mosaic Law like in Leviticus. In 1 Cor, we see Paul giving warning to the church because of sexual immorality among them, and warns them of various things including what is in the verse above telling them that those people ""will not inherit the kingdom of God.""

**Traditional View:** 

These verses clearly show that homosexual acts are sinful. But in order to understand why, we need to look at the original language. In 1 Cor, we see the words ""men who have sex with men"" which is actually the English translation of two Greek words that refer to the passive and active participants in homosexual acts. The verse is basically saying ""neither \_\_\_\_\_\_ nor \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ will inherit the kingdom of God."" The first is ""malakos"" which roughly translates to effeminate, and is referring to the passive partner in homosexual sex by most scholars (the one who is being penetrated). The next word is ""arsenokoites"" which is a compound word created by putting two words from Leviticus together. The two words are ""arsen"" which means male and ""koites"" which means bed, which are found in Leviticus 18:22 and 20:13. This word created by Paul, who was a scholar for his time, is believed to mean ""men who bed men"" or ""men who have sex with men"" as in the verse above. So while we aren't under the Mosaic Law anymore, we see Paul clearly pulling from the Mosaic Law to affirm that homosexual acts are still sinful, despite the Law being fulfilled in Christ (remember that Apostles have the ability to speak authoritatively, so Paul can say that homosexual acts are sinful only if they actually are). Not only are homosexual acts sinful, but they are sinful for all people. They are sinful for the ones who are being penetrated AND they are sinful for the ones doing the penetrating. This is important to clarify because in Greek/Roman cultures, it was acceptable for a male of higher status to have sex with a male of lower status. However, Paul is going against that accepted dichotomy and saying it isn't okay in any capacity, even if the culture says it is.

Lastly, while the word ""malakos"" can have a more broad meaning as we will discuss below, ""arsenokoites"" has a more narrow meaning. We see arsenokoites always referring to men having sex with men in ancient literature, which includes post-New Testament literature like the Sibylline Oracles, Hippolytus' Refutation of All Heresies, and Eusebius' Preparation for the Gospel. Based on historical and literary context, there can be no doubt what these words mean. Similarly in 1 Tim 1:10, we see the same word ""arsenokoites"" used by Paul here.

**Affirming View:** 

Now the common affirming view is that these verses specifically address the exploitation of people, not loving and monogamous marriages between same-sex people. Specifically people will say that Paul is specifically talking about grooming or pederasty of some kind. There are a few reasons affirming Christians come to this view, and I think they are all **extremely** weak. The first is that the Greek word ""malakos"" used above can be used to refer to a boy kept or used for homosexual relations with a man (a catamite). However, it can also be used to refer to a male who submits his body to unnatural lewdness or a male prostitute. **Remember, words can have more than just one specific meaning**. When we look at the context of what Paul is discussing, the context of the word he is using, and the context of the other word he uses to discuss homosexual acts, it is clear that Paul is not talking specifically about just catamite relationships, but all homosexual relationships. Affirming Christians will often say ""well monogamous same-sex relationships didn't really exist back then, so Paul wouldn't have even really known to denounce them"", but that isn't true. **Pederasty wasn’t the only form of same-sex relations common in their day**. Josephus speaks out **against same-sex relations in the context of marriage laws** (*Apion* 2.199), and several other Jewish writers prohibited homosexual relations without reference to age distinctions (*Letter of Aristeas* 152; *Ps. Phoc.* 3; *b. Sanhedrin* 58a, *Sifra Ahare* 9:8, and *Sifra* on Leviticus 18:3). Furthermore—*and most importantly*—pederasty didn’t exist among female same-sex relations, which were often **consensual** and **non-exploitative.** Still, Jewish and Christian authors unanimously prohibited female same-sex relations *on the same grounds that they prohibited male same-sex relations. -* [Dr. Preston Sprinkles](https://theologyintheraw.com/the-sin-of-homosexuality/).

Some will also inaccurately point out that Paul could have used already existing words to describe same-sex acts like ""erastes"" and ""eromenos"" but these words have contexts that directly and specifically reference pederastry or grooming relationships. Clearly, Paul NOT using those words is showing that he isn't talking just about certain homosexual relations, but ALL homosexual relations.

People will also claim that the word ""homosexuality"" didn't exist until the late 1800s, which is true. But that doesn't mean Paul didn't understand or have any idea what it was. Like all translation, we took the words used in the original text, and used a English word that best fit with the original text. Sometimes that words comes sooner, and sometimes that word comes later. Just because homosexuality wasn't a word until recently does nothing to change that Paul is clearly talking about homosexual acts of all kinds. In the case of Scripture, homosexuality made the most sense for some translations to include since Paul is clearly prohibiting what we would call today ""homosexuality."" Of course with that said, I do believe ""homosexuality"" isn't the best word to use, because Biblically it is the homosexual acts that are sinful, not the attraction. However, the word homosexuality can be used to refer to homosexual acts OR someone that is attracted to the same sex. As mentioned above, one can have an attraction to the same sex but resist their temptations and not sin. So in that regard, I want to affirm that one can be a ""homosexual"" (ie. they are attracted to the same sex) but still live a life honoring to the Lord, and also that the word choice isn't the best.

# CONCLUSION (PART 1)

In terms of the verses above (especially Romans) we need to ask the question, ""are Paul's words limited to a specific form of same-sex relation, or does his description include **all forms**, including consensual, monogamous, faithful same-sex relations. The biggest reasons I can't seem to agree with the idea of it only being related to rape or pederasty are as follows:

1. There are many Greek words used to describe pederasty, and none of them are used. There also isn't any mention of master-slave relations, rape, or prostitution. **Paul could have used the Greek word ""paiderastes"" to specifically show he was talking about pederasty, but didn't.**
2. Paul uses language of mutuality throughout the passage. ""males with other males"" but no mention of slaves, or creepy men with innocent boys. The language Paul uses is always equal relationships.
3. In this time female same-sex relationships were largely consensual, and yet Paul considers these to be against nature still, and compares them to male same-sex relationships.
4. Paul doesn't say that people exchanged non-lustful, consensual forms of sexual relations for lustful, oppressive forms. Rather, he says that they exchanged opposite sex relations for same-sex relations. Therefore, the idea that it is specifically about lust doesn't make sense. Again, Paul could have said that.

As I have mentioned before, you can get **a LOT more detail regarding the points above by reading Preston Sprinkle's article**. Simply just reading these points might be sufficient, but you can gain a lot of context and information that you won't get just by reading this. *And the article isn't that long!*

I want to end this section by speaking to those (again) who are **too focused**, in my opinion, **about the cultural context of the time**. Cultural context should absolutely be used to understand Scripture, but it cannot be held up as the same or greater than Scripture. There is no amount of cultural context in the world that would make what Paul says NOT mean all homosexual acts, because if that was the case then Paul could have simply said that. **But he didn't**. He never once clarifies that these homosexual acts are only sinful under certain conditions. There were plenty of examples of all kinds of homosexual acts in his time, and he choose to not speak specifically on any of them. Rather, he choose to speak broadly about all homosexual acts. Therefore, any Bible believing Christian **MUST** take Paul at his word based on the context of Scripture and original language. To appeal to the culture at the time as a way to undermine Paul's words is putting the culture above what Paul himself said. Not to mention, if we believe that God spoke through the Kings, Prophets, Jesus, and the Apostles in order to create His Holy Scripture, **we can surely believe that God is capable of giving Paul words that would transcend his cultural understanding** in order to make it clear to us that homosexual acts were permissible. But again, he didn't. If we fixate too much on culture and say ""well Paul wouldn't have had any knowledge of X type of relationship, so clearly he isn't talking about X"" then we are making God and the Bible less.

# BODY (PART 2)

Now I want to tackle some of the common reasons affirming Christians believe what they do, as mentioned above.

**1. You may not care (or know) what Scripture says regarding homosexual acts, and base your theology on what makes people the most happy or what is ""loving"" to others.**

* It is totally understandable that you may have been misled into believing homosexual acts were okay. We live in a culture that cares less about Biblical accuracy and more about making sure people feel included. And I want people to feel included, but not by sacrificing the truth of Scripture. That is not what Jesus wanted. Jesus wanted us to love others AND hold to Biblical truth. He wanted us to have compassion for those who were suffering, while remaining faithful to Scripture. As Christians, we cannot just base our theology on what makes people the most happy or because ""it isn't hurting anyone"" because if it is sinful, it doesn't matter how happy it makes someone or if it doesn't hurt anyone, **it is still sin**. As Christians, we are called to affirm the truth of Scripture, no matter how much we don't like it. And I agree with you! I don't like that homosexual acts are sinful. I wish same-sex attracted people could get married and have families. **But I can't ignore Scripture just because I don't like what it says**. I have to follow all of it, or none of it. I don't get to pick and choose, because then I'm not really a Christian, but just using Christianity to feel good about myself.
* And side note, to any Christians who are concerned by my language above saying ""I don't like that homosexual acts are a sin"", I want to clarify some things. I think it's totally fine to say essentially ""yeah I don't understand this, and if I was God, maybe I'd do it differently"" while also being able to say ""I am not God, will never be God, and am called to love and honor Him completely, no matter what His law says. And also, I recognize His law is fully loving and good for all people."" That is basically what I am saying above. We must love God's Law and follow it no matter what, even if we don't understand it.

**2. You reject Paul and the Apostles words as authoritative, and only focus on the words of Jesus who never directly talks about homosexual acts.**

* The Bible is clear that the Apostles spoke authoritatively ([including Paul](https://www.blueletterbible.org/Comm/stewart_don/faq/bible-authoritative-word/question21-paul-considered-authoritative.cfm)), and that their words are the same as Jesus's words in truth and authority (of course they can't speak anything authoritatively that would be against God's character, because the Holy Spirit is within them assisting them through their writing). At the end of the day, I can't convince you of that, but the early church held to that view (and they knew Jesus and the Apostles), so who am I to disagree with them AND what Scripture says? **Jesus's words are SO important, but so are the Apostles words.**
* Also, while Jesus never directly talks about homosexual acts we do see him in [Matthew 19](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%2019&version=NIV) affirm that marriage is between a man and a woman. If Jesus didn't talk about homosexuality because he truly believed it was okay, then he could have affirmed that here easily. Yet he says a man with a woman, not 1 person with 1 person regardless of gender. Some might say ""yeah well if he said that he would have been killed because that was blasphemy"" but Jesus literally did that multiple times and the Jews wanted to kill him. Why would he all of a sudden care about blasphemy and the Jews trying to kill him in this instance, but not the ones before? Of course, some may also appeal to [polygamy](https://www.logos.com/grow/does-jesus-contradict-the-old-testament-on-polygamy/) as well when we think about Biblical marriage, but I don't think it's relevant and won't spend the time on it here.
* Lastly, we see that Jesus's ministry was focused toward Jews, while Paul's ministry was focused toward Greeks (and other non-Jews). The Jews, after the return to Jerusalem under the Persian Empire, realized that their exile and slavery was due to their lack of faith toward God. So Jewish culture was basically rehauled, and they turned toward God and very strictly shunned anything that was outside or against their faith (and followed the OT Law). That is the same culture we see during Jesus's ministry. **So the Jews heavily opposed Greek/Roman culture, and the Greek/Roman culture was the culture that was open to homosexual acts as mentioned above**. Since Jesus's ministry was to the Jews, he had no reason to address homosexuality because it was a part of the Greek/Roman culture that Jews had already rejected. Also, Jesus didn't need to address it because **the OT Law had already addressed it**, since at this point the Jews were still under the OT Law, which prohibited homosexuality. Lastly, Paul DOES mention it which makes sense because his ministry was to the Gentiles, with cultures that approved of homosexual acts. **Jesus didn't mention it because he didn't have to, Paul mentioned it because he did have to.**

**3. You reject traditional Biblical theology and appeal to the culture of the time over the words within Scripture.**

* As explained above, we can see that traditional Biblical theology is definitely on my side. It takes EXTREME logical leaps to believe that the Bible isn't talking about all types of homosexual relationships. Likewise, we can see that the culture of that time still affirms the points I made above. It wasn't like the culture was ONLY grooming or pederasty, but monogamous relationships as well. Are there places in the Bible where we can appeal to culture as a way to say something is or isn't for us today? Yes absolutely. However, the context of Scripture often makes it very clear what is just a cultural command or idea, and what is authoritative. In the instance of homosexuality, the context makes it clear that it isn't just something for that culture, and not us today, especially because it comes up multiple times in Scripture, not just once in a specific book of the NT. Some may try to point out the specific sexual/relational cultures of the Greek or Roman empires during those times, and point out that the church likely evaluated things differently than we would today. They will point out how those cultures viewed monogamous female relationships, and bring up fears those cultures had relating to men's and women's roles in society. They may also point out how male-male sex was inherently dishonorable in that culture for the person being penetrated (that person having a lesser societal role) vs. male-male sex today not making 1 person more dishonorable or socially lesser. Lastly, they may mention how homosexual acts were viewed as lacking self-control or having an out-of-control sexuality.
* **I wholly reject these claims as proof that homosexual acts are permissible today for a few reasons.**
   * **1.** The gospel is counter-cultural. It is likely Paul knows about these things (although he doesn't care to mention them as qualifiers in the Bible), but the gospel and the words Paul spoke during that time were very much against the norm. It is very likely that this instance is the same. Paul is making a counter cultural claim that all homosexual acts, no matter if you are the active or passive partners, are sinful. Or that no matter what anyone thinks, it is still sinful (ie. ""can two females ***really*** have sex?"" was a thought in that day, because penetration couldn't occur)
   * **2.** I already mentioned it, but Paul doesn't make any sort of distinction regarding any of these cultural ideals. He doesn't talk about how the Greeks or Romans viewed sex, he doesn't talk about how it isn't okay ONLY in certain contexts like if the acts are with someone of lesser societal value, etc. He just plainly says it is wrong, according to the evidence provided above.
   * **3.** I believe that the Lord has spoken through the Bible, using people like Paul, and that it is a book that spans times and cultures. If the Lord really wanted us to take into account all of these different cultural ideas, then he would have made sure Paul talked about it. But that didn't happen. To say, ""well the culture was very different and there clearly weren't any homosexual acts of people that had equal status unlike today, therefore homosexual acts today are acceptable"" is just stretching what it means to view the Bible in an inappropriate cultural lens. It is using the culture to control the truth of the Bible and it is reading things into the Bible that God clearly didn't want to be in it. If an all-powerful God wanted us to know that homosexual acts today were okay due to cultural reasons, **then that would have been made clear in the Bible**. Similarly to the ideas of tattoos. It is very easy to make an argument that tattoos aren't sinful culturally and Biblically anymore. We never see any prohibition against it, expect in the Old Testament. But as mentioned, we aren't under the Old Testament Laws anymore. Likewise, we can easily see that tattoos in that time were used for idol worship, which is the main reason the Lord banned them. Now if the New Testament said that tattoos were banned, then I think it wouldn't be enough to just say ""well culturally they were mostly used for idol worship, and so they are okay to get"" but that we really need to think **""Why did the Bible not put these cultural justifications in it?""** Is it because they forgot? Is it because they just hoped we'd figure it out? *Or is it because the cultural justifications don't matter in some instances*? In this instance, I think one can conclude, if they are being intellectually honest with all that has been stated above, that the cultural argument is not enough to believe homosexual acts are permissible today.

**4. You theologically believe that the Bible is affirming of monogamous same-sex marriages.**

* As shown above, there is no way one can be intellectually honest and believe the Bible affirms monogamous same-sex marriages. If one believes that, it is likely because they either just want to believe what makes people happy regardless of what Scripture says or they deny Paul's writings. Both of which are things one cannot do and honestly call themselves a Christian for.

# CONCLUSION (PART 2)

Ultimately there is nothing I can really do to convince you. If you are a Christian, the Holy Spirit will have to do that. But I hope this can help give you more knowledge on what the Bible really says regarding this issue. It is definitely complicated, but I believe it is the duty of all Christians to be highly educated on it. And as I said, don't take my words for anything. Read what I said above, look at Scripture, look up commentaries, and learn more yourself! Also, pray that the Holy Spirit would open your eyes and mind to understand or see what you might not have seen before.

And lastly, **it is imperative that Christians love others.** Some will say ""well you want to say that homosexual acts are sinful, so you can't be loving"" and I don't believe that. We can hold truth to Scripture and love others well, share the gospel with them, disciple them, etc. So I pray that you can know and experience the Lord deeper, and that you would continue to grow in your faith.

2025-01-01 04:22:48,"Why there will be a resurgence of exmormons rejoining the Church. 
 We've all seen the social media accounts, heard the stories, and are aware of the seemingly increasing trend of ""exmormons"" rejoining the Church.  They are the newest group that is being heralded and paraded by Church members as the counterbalance to the prevailing trend of the day. 

In past generations there was ""the tattooed mormon"" that stood as a symbol of unorthodox converts when missionary converts were dwindling.  Then there were the mixed-orientation marriages that were held up on a pedestal as a sign that the growing acceptance of LGBT relationships in the mainstream culture were thwarted by adherence to the gospel.  The biggest threat to the Church and more importantly, church culture, and its perceived relevance by members are the increasing numbers of members leaving activity and church membership behind. 

The antidote to the cognitive dissonance created by members seeing loved ones stepping away from the Church is to build a narrative that many that leave are returning.  For Gen X and Millenial exmormons, the odds of them returning to full activity are small and getting smaller by the day.  However, the current generation of exmormons that are active on social media and are going through a faith crisis are unlike any group of exmormons that have existed in the past. 

# Diffusion of Innovations / Social Contagion: 

Looking at the rise and popularity of exmormonism over the past 4 decades, I think it's helpful to plot it onto a model of diffusion of ideas and social acceptance popularized in the 1962 called the [""Diffusion of Innovations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_of_innovations#Failed_diffusion)"".  The theory postulates that there is a consistent categorization of people into different  groups based on their acceptance and adoption of new ideas.  The names of the major groups are common parlance now and known to all of us:  Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards.  An example of these categories and their sizes are below: 

  

https://preview.redd.it/zakc3zs37bae1.png?width=780&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b26af7a2fcb2f867eb8a69b1f3edfb449279226

Another component of the theory is the idea of ""critical mass"" or the point in which an idea or movement reaches enough momentum and size that it is self-perpetuating and self-sustaining.  It is usually assumed that once something reaches critical mass it will eventually reach 100% market saturation, however that's not always the case, and at times ideas or products fail to fully diffuse. 

# Innovators

Bringing this back to Mormonism and exmormonism in particular, I think it's safe to say that nearly the entirety of the 20th century was owned by exmormon innovators.  They were the scholars and researchers that found new data and evidences hidden by the Church, or at least not publicly highlighted and have given all of us information that has been shaping and reforming the LDS gospel for the past 2 decades.  Researchers and authors like: Fawn Brodie, Jerald and Sandra Tanner, Michael Quinn, Leonard Arrington, Brent Metcalf, Simon Sotherton, and so many others provided the information that available but only known to a few with specialties in mormon studies and adjacent fields. 

# Early Adopters

In the early to late 2000s that information began to circulate among early adopters through internet forums, chat groups, and email lists.  Due to the internets availability of information, and more importantly the ability to share large blocks of text and documents nearly effortlessly and in real time with other people allowed for the early adopters to begin synthesizing and summarizing the past centuries worth of research into understandable and digestible information for non-scholars. 

That summary and collation of research resulted in the next wave of media surrounding exmormonism: the podcast.  This made information accessible not only to those who could afford the time and effort to sit online and comb through piles of written dialogue about obscure academic work, but that same information was now available in an entertaining format to anyone with headphones and a block of time that they could listen to something while they were engaged in other activities.  Notable podcasts include: Mormon Expressions, Mormon Stories, Infants on Thrones, and others that spun off from those as they became more popular. 

# Early Majority

With the rise of social media, and especially anonymous sites like reddit, users were able to find a community of like-minded individuals to not only share their experiences with, but to communicate about their challenges, struggles, and transitions in their lives as they incorporated the new information that was coming out from podcasts and other sources like the CES Letter.  Those early majority adopters were heavily influenced by the early adopters and their courage to publicly stand up and speak the truth that they had found.  Unlike the Innovators and Early Adopters that were nearly all excommunicated or at the least threatened by the Church unless they silenced themselves, the anonymous nature of social media allowed the early majority to work through their fear and with the growing numbers of similarly minded people find the social capital needed to make the leap from ""physically in but mentally out"", to fully out and ""exmormon"". 

Many here won't realize it, but there was a time for years when it so socially taboo to be exmormon that nearly everyone on exmormon reddit was anonymous and intentionally kept it that way.   It was a really BIG deal when someone was willing to put their name, or even a picture of themselves online as an exmormon.  Over a period of years as the exmormon community grew, it became a badge of honor to publicly post a ""selfie"" and publicly claiming the title of an exmormon, or at least nuanced mormon.  That shift from anonymity to public acceptance occurred as the early majority fully accepted the increasingly common narrative that the LDS Church was not what it claimed to be, and its history showed that it's claims were not supported by the evidence and research. 

# Late Majority

Unlike the Early Majority that didn't have the social capital (at first) to publicly acknowledge their beliefs, and had to pioneer how to explain to family, friends, and wards, why they were stepping away from the Church, the Late Majority of the past 4-5 years is unburdened by the generational indoctrination and sacrifice to the institutional Church that the previous generations had under their belt by the time they discovered new information about the Church's teachings.  The exmormon narrative was the dominant narrative on almost all social media channels by that time, and it had become a frequent topic of general and local conferences hosted by the Church.  Exmormonism by this time had moved from a niche subset of people to mainstream mormon culture. 

With the decreased stigma, and ever increasing popularity of exmormonism, it is much easier and more common for a teenager or young adult to leave the Church without undergoing the significant deconstruction that so many of the early adopters and early majority members struggled with.  It has been said that it takes roughly 1 month of deconstruction for every year of active membership within the Church as an adult.  With less time sacrificed to the Church's teachings, it's just easier for younger members to walk away. 

# The Repercussions of the Sunk Cost

The reason why the sunk cost fallacy is a fallacy, is because we are prone to the cognitive bias that rewards us for not giving up on something that we have spent considerable resources on, whether that is time, money, or just effort.  So for early adopters and the early majority that had decades of ""sunk cost"" into mormonism, it required an commensurate amount of motivation and effort to leave.  The repercussions of that principle on the younger generations are that Mormonism is much easier to leave, or to go.  The cost is much lower, and benefits are seemingly much higher for either choice. 

This is one reason why I think there will be an escalating number of younger exmormons that will return to the Church.  Despite its truth claims, its history, and its social teachings, the LDS Church does provide a very reliable, stable, framework for living within a community that allows for social connections, service, and rituals to mark major life events.  While some teachings are actively psychologically harmful to its adherents, teachings like the Word of Wisdom safeguard members from actions that cause equally real and harmful outcomes that exmormons are subjected to when they leave if they choose to follow their own moral standards. 

For some people, they are happier and healthier within a structured framework like mormonism than they are outside of it.  We all crave community, and mormonism provides that.  Many exmormons will find and create community outside of mormonism, and those that do are likely to remain outside of Church activity.  But for those that can't/won't, mormonism will be waiting for them with open arms.  Even more so, when they can be like the prodigal son returning and showered with praise for going out on their own, but returning contrite and repentant, and ready to tell the faithful about all of the dangers of the outside world that the faithful have been avoiding.  For now, those that return will be the lastest examples of counterculture that are put on a pedestal and paraded by the faithful as the example of how right they are, and how wrong the prevailing mainstream culture is. 

The only question yet to be answered is, has exmormonism reached its own form of critical mass?  Or will the next generation revert to faithfulness?

**Andrew’s Perspective**

Following my conversation with Zimera in which she supplied me with a spare communicator, curiosity rather quickly outgrew my sense as I found myself surfing their web in search of any information that might help me.

The Irigon’s information highway was shockingly analogous to that of my own kind: operating primarily off of a search engine labeled ‘Net Steward’—presumably state-funded judging by the name and lack of other options. Even if the information was censored, however, it’d still be better than nothing.

Taking a deep breath to steel myself against whatever horrors lay beyond, I activated the virtual keyboard and began typing out queries in the Irigon language I could now understand pretty much perfectly.

“First things first…” I murmured, typing in the names of the two species Zimera had mentioned during our private debate. My spelling wasn’t precisely perfect, but fortunately came close enough to give the communicator an inkling as to what I wanted from it.

Clicking on the first result for ‘Rekis’, I was surprised by how forthcoming the information was. Documented meticulously within the Imperial site on which I’d found myself were details of this species history extending back hundreds of years before their integration, along with notes on their evolution. Their home planet (the name of which I wasn’t even going to try to pronounce) was apparently far more hostile than most. Its orbit on the outer rim of an M-class star’s habitable zone resulted in a cold, harsh environment. The only areas that had been habitable for permanent settlements during their stone age were patches of verdant forest surrounding their planet’s numerous volcanoes. Some Irigon scholars cited this immense resource limitation as the reason behind the Rekis’ genocidal culture. That being said, the advent of better agricultural technology and the end of an ice age on this planet meant the Rekis practice of culling their own was likely entirely unnecessary once they reached the medieval age. By that point, however, such a practice had been so deeply ingrained into their culture that they continued it regardless of need.

In terms of environment, the Yqail’s home planet was almost the complete opposite. Large swaths of tropical rainforests and open savannas decorated the surface of their home planet, Gricot; which was surprising given that its sapient species had evolved from desert-dwellers. The culture documented here was as brutal and lawless as Zimera had made it out to be. Due to their planet’s singular continent not unlike the Pangea of prehistoric Earth, the culture of this species had become fairly monolithic by the dawn of their industrial age. Lacking a central government to enforce currency, the Yqail primarily operated off of an anarcho-capitalist barter economy. The closest thing these aliens had to a planetary leader was a warlord nicknamed Kaarak who had *some-fucking-how* managed to monopolize firearms. Literally all era-appropriate guns on the planet were manufactured by his army of slaves. These involuntary workers were frequently executed if they failed to make quota—even children were not exempt.

Apparently those were not the only two species in the empire with downright awful pasts. Indeed, out of the 13 other peoples I digitally dug into that night, 4 of them were of a similar moral caliber—that’s not to say the others were perfect, just that they were leaps and bounds ahead of the worst. Returning to the search bar, I hummed in contemplation as my fingers flew across the keyboard yet again in typing out a question I wasn’t exactly sure how to word.

`Why do other civilizations…`I paused, unsure how to continue the thought. Hovering below the search bar were a collection of automatic results: the first among them being ‘why do other civilizations fail?’

Much as the question made my blood boil with its sheer arrogance, I could hardly deny my own curiosity regarding how the Irigon might deign to answer it. Inhaling deeply yet again in preparation for the sheer volume of utter bullshit I was about to subject myself to, I tapped upon the autocomplete and selected the first result, labeled `The Civilization Hypothesis`

Essentially, as far as the writer posits, because life on other planets evolves competitively, so too do civilizations that develop there. From the very moment sapients on one planet develop a culture, that culture will perpetually be at war against other ways of life. Supposedly, within this perpetual conflict, peaceful and cooperative cultures unwilling to surrender their morals will universally collapse beneath the crushing weight of more oppressive ones willing to perform the terrible acts necessary to win out. This section of the paper concluded with a reference to some quote from a famous philosopher within their empire. *“The good handicap one of their legs before battle because to do so befits their morals. The evil take this chance to cripple the other because to do so befits their morals.”*

After that quote, the author began to contrast this usual civilizational development with that of their own people. Whereas most ‘good’ civilizations are devoured in their cradle by ravenous siblings before they can even defend themselves, the modern Irigon culture of rights and empathy was lucky enough to be born alongside only twins of itself, allowing them a chance to mature and blend into *the* galactic superpower—for there were no others as far as they could tell

With more scholarly research lacking in direction, I eventually turned my eyes to a more pedestrian perspective: specifically that of Irigon social media. Plastered upon the front page of their predominant platform I found all manner of images and videos depicting dozens of different species coexisting together. In one video, an amphibian-like alien was explaining the intricacies of her favorite movie series, while in another a Rekis infant could be seen playing with an Irigon who—judging by the captions—was his adoptive mother. Apparently, an election cycle was rolling around within the empire, and with it came a veritable pile of political adverts. One thing I very quickly noticed was that despite the diversity of their empire, only Irigon candidates could be seen. Digging further into this, I discovered rather quickly the reasoning behind this anomaly. According to one imperial law, no person belonging to a ‘competitive’ species could run for non-advisory roles in public office.

Setting aside that revelation, however, there was something admittedly soothing about scrolling through their social media. Everyone seemed so *happy* with their lot in life that for the briefest moment I was almost lulled into believing the Irigon’s lie. *Almost*. These people weren’t happy *because* they had everything taken from them; they were happy in spite of it. In fact, for all I knew, none of them were even real—I wouldn’t put it past Zimera to construct this whole page as an elaborate lie to trick new species into signing away their freedom.

No. I couldn’t allow this fate to befall Humanity, nor the Kafel. Somehow, I had to find a way to combat them. In order to do so, I had to better understand what we were up against. “How many ships in Irigon fleet…” I murmured to myself as I typed, clicking upon the resulting link: an official report by their military.

The numbers were staggering. One *million* destroyers, hundreds of thousands of cruisers, and over one thousand dreadnoughts. Though it had been thousands of years since their last galactic war, the Irigon were apparently determined not to be caught off-guard. Complimenting this already-ridiculous setup were three dozen battleships the size of small moons and one vessel ominously referred to as ‘Finality’.

My throat felt dry with anxiety as I typed the name into the search bar. `Finality`. This, as far as the Irigon claimed, was their most impressive feat of military engineering: a mobile Dyson-sphere tooled to all-out war and equipped with multiple planet-destroying weapons. Though never officially used in battle, this vessel would nevertheless be capable of taking on a fleet of millions by itself. Ever scarier than that fact alone was that they were apparently planning to build ten more in the following centuries.

Dread drilled into my chest as I contemplated just how hopeless the situation was. Unless I could somehow talk the Irigon into staying their hand, it would be next to impossible for Humanity to stand against them. This was a civilization *thousands* of years ahead of ours; there was no future in which a fight between us would be anything remotely close to fair.

Suddenly, the communicators’ search engine seemed to shut down of its own volition, and I found myself staring at a blank notes page. For a moment I simply sat there upon the bed, perplexed by what had just happened. Then, however, a collection of words I hadn't expected appeared on screen. `”You want freedom for your species?”` It asked, prompting a paranoid search of my surroundings as I looked for any hidden cameras or other devices Zimera could be using to monitor me. `”Relax...”` It continued, seemingly in response to my newfound suspicions. `”I'm a friend. Here to help.”`

""Like hell you are..."" I  murmured beneath by breath. This had to be one of Zimera's games. Maybe she was planning to coax out more information on Earth by pretending to be some kind of rebel hacker.

`How about I prove it?` The text continued, uploading the link to a file containing some kind of massive physics equation. `”Those are the galactic coordinates of Earth. Zimera wants them so the empire can 'rescue' Earth. If you do as I say, you can use this to send an FTL message warning them.”`

""Who are you?"" I whispered into the mic.

`”Like I said: a friend.”`

This was *not* a satisfactory answer. ""Listen here,"" I hissed, trying my best to keep my voice down despite the well of emotions bubbling up within. ""I'm done just taking peoples' word for things. Tell me who you are before I launch this fucking thing across the room!""

For a few seconds, the screen went blank, inciting within me fears that I might've laid it on too strong. Eventually, however, whoever was on the other side decided to continue. `”Call me Baoth. I'm the leader of a resistance movement called the Recalcitrants.”`

""Alright then, Baoth..."" I murmured quietly, watching as the text deleted itself upon my acknowledgement. ""You said I can warn Humanity?""

`”Assuming you can access a comms network, yes. You'll need to slip Zimera's grasp to find one, but if you can, I should be able to mask the signal so nobody here detects it.”`

""And what then?"" I asked despairingly. ""What the fuck is Humanity going to do about this? We can't fight them.""

`”Listen...”` The text continued. `”I don't contact every species like this. For most of them, you'd be right that there is no hope. That being said, I've calculated a 0.86% chance Humanity can pull this off if you just do as I say. Bottom line; if you want the Kafel and Humanity to stay independent, you have to do everything I ask.”`

""But why are *you* fighting them?""

Again, the text took awhile to appear, suggesting that its author was thinking heavily about what next to say. `”I believe in the freedom of a species to decide its own fate; for better or worse. With your help, we can break the cycle of pain perpetuated by my misguided kin.”`

""Let's say I was in..."" I began, maintaining a healthy degree of skepticism regarding the true intentions of this enigmatic correspondence. ""What would you want me to do?""

`For now, I need you to focus on sending that signal to your species. If you can do that, I have a plan for what we'll do next. You'll need to send the message within two months. If you don't, your kind won't have enough time to prepare. I sent you the address of our hideout in this city. Once you escape Zimera, go there and we can talk again. Do we have a deal?`

It seemed that I had only two options here. I *could* warn Humanity about the Irigon, going along with this longshot plan. Then again, if I used the location of Earth as a bargaining chip with Zimera, perhaps I could convince her to try something different this time. Neither option seemed ideal. That being said, if this was my only chance to accept Baoth’s help, I had only one question left to ask. ""Why Humanity?""

This time, my answer came in without delay. `”Your kind are special. Unique in every way. You're not like the rest. No other species besides we Irigon has passed the interstellar filter. If the Irigon are perfection, than Humanity is it's antithesis. Your people are perfectly wrong, and that's exactly what we need.”`

2025-07-20 05:14:11,"I remade an OC dragon species I wanted to make at 9, but I did not know how to draw bones, so here is the DeathWhisper, better than ever. “It doesn’t roar… it murmurs death.”

Species Name: Mortifer Sibilans (Latin: ""Death-bearing Whisperer"") 

Length: 25-35 feet (nose to tail tip)

Wingspan: 15–25 feet

Height at Shoulder: 10 feet

Weight: 4.2 tons

Habitat: Thick bone forests, ancient ruins, volcanic badlands, or deep valley fog zones. The Death Whistle prefers lands where silence prevails — where winds howl and echo can stretch unbroken for miles. It dens in underground stone labyrinths, or carves its own twisted burrows using its clawed limbs and tail. With wings, it now roosts on sheer cliff faces, forgotten towers, or mist-wrapped mountain spires where it can whisper to the world below.

Appearance: Though it bears the look of a skeletal beast risen from the Underworld, the Death Whistle’s bones are deceptive — mere bioluminescent markings, bright white against its inky, void-black skin. These markings serve both camouflage and psychological warfare, creating the illusion of a moving skeleton even in moonlight.

Wings are vast, leathery, and hooked like a bat’s (Did not include bat wings in the picture for visibility). The membrane is almost entirely black with streaks of the same skeletal white, forming ghostly outlines of ribs and vertebrae along the arc of the wingspan — as though the Death Whistle's own bones are trying to escape its flesh. When gliding above fog or moonlight, it looks like a reaper drifting over a battlefield.

Behavior: Mysterious. Territorial. Calculating. The Death Whistle is not a mindless predator — it is a lurker, a patient hunter that observes for hours before it moves. Unlike most dragons, it prefers to not be seen until it chooses to be.

Its vocalizations are its most haunting trait. The Death Whistle does not roar — instead, it produces an ear-splitting whisper through multiple vented chambers in its horns, nose, and throat. The sound mimics human whispers, ghostly murmurs, or distant screams, often layered in disorienting stereo, triggering panic, nausea, or hallucinations in some humans. Night patrols have been driven to madness hearing the whisper across the fog.

However, this whistle is not just auditory — it's a sonic weapon. It can rupture eardrums, crack fragile stone, and disorient prey. The Death Whistle uses it to stun foes before moving in with powerful limb strikes, headbutts, suffocating tail wraps, or skyborne ambush dives.

Attack:

Range: Medium (10–15 yards effective)

Damage Type: Sonic / Psychological / Structural

Abilities & Features: Whisper Bomb: Focused blast of whispering soundwaves that can disorient both dragon and human foes alike.

Skeleton Camouflage: In the right lighting, especially moonlight or volcanic glow, the markings give the illusion of floating bones, confusing attackers.

Murk Adaptation: Excellent vision in low-light. Can see heat signatures through fog and smoke.

Burrower’s Claws: Front claws are jagged and reverse-hooked, allowing it to scale vertical stone or dig ambush pits.

Silent Soar: The wings of the Death Whistle are designed for silent gliding. Its flight is unnaturally soundless, especially when hunting from above.

Death Spiral: A combat maneuver where the dragon spirals downward in a silent dive, releasing whisper shockwaves just before impact to disorient prey.

Speed: Land Speed: ★★★★☆ Powerful quadruped with agile turns. Can leap surprisingly far and high for its size.

Swimming: ★★★☆☆ While not aquatic, the Death Whistle is an excellent submerged lurker in bogs or marshes. Uses its tail for propulsion and stealth movement.

Flight: ★★★★☆ With its immense wings, the Death Whistle is a glider more than a flier. It doesn't flap often — instead, it rides thermals, fog fronts, and high currents. Capable of long-distance travel in eerie, noiseless grace. Its shadow alone is often all that’s seen before the whistle begins.

Trainability: ★★★☆☆ (Tameable by rare individuals only)

Taming a Death Whistle requires absolute respect, silence, and empathy. It is not a dragon to be dominated — it chooses its rider. Eye contact is a challenge, not an invitation, and the bond must be built through ritual, quiet companionship, and endurance.

Dragon Riders who’ve succeeded often spent weeks in the fogs near a Death Whistle’s territory, mimicking its sounds back at it, learning its rhythms, and proving they weren’t prey. Trust is slow, but once earned, it is fierce and unbreakable — these dragons have been known to refuse new riders after their bonded human dies, even wandering into battle and vanishing into the wild rather than be captured.

Intelligence: ★★★★★ The Death Whistle is highly intelligent, capable of problem-solving, memory retention, and even mimicry. Some have reportedly mimicked lost loved ones' voices to lure prey, suggesting a chillingly advanced understanding of human emotion.

Disobedience: ★★★★☆ Will ignore commands if disrespected. Has a mind of its own, and won’t fight meaningless battles. Needs to feel purpose and honor in its choices.

Bonding Type: Spiritual — not food- or dominance-based. It recognizes emotional frequency more than physical prowess. Some believe it can “hear” the soul.

Rarity: Uncommon to Rare More common in regions of war, plague, or silence — this species is drawn to places of long-standing sorrow or forgotten history. Some scholars believe it absorbs memory through the earth and has a near-mythical connection to death itself.

Villages say if you hear the whisper at night and don't respond… you’re safe. But if you whisper back?

It may answer.

Known Weaknesses: 

Bright daylight: Avoids sunlit environments, though it will endure it when necessary.

Reflected sound: Echoing chambers can sometimes confuse its sonar-based strikes.

Vulnerability during takeoff: Though graceful in flight, it needs a moment to spread wings and launch. Open-field ambushes can clip it before lift-off.

Additional Notes 

Legends say Death Whistles were once guardians of the boundary between life and death, and that their presence meant a soul was not yet ready to pass on.

Some tribes believe their whispers are echoes of the dead trying to warn the living.

Saddle-compatible, but custom design needed — typical harnesses don’t account for mane or bone ridges.

Combat Style 

Primary Combat Type: Psychological warfare, ambush predator

Preferred Terrain: Dense forests, rocky outcroppings, swamps, and ruins

Weaknesses: Bright sunlight (agitated or slowed in direct heat), overwhelming sound (such as dragon roars), fast-flying enemies

Strengths: Night combat, stealth operations, disabling enemies without being seen

The Death Whistle never charges unless cornered. Instead, it prowls, manipulates, and terrifies. By the time an enemy realizes it is under attack, it is often already paralyzed or broken mentally.

Abilities & Special Traits 

🦴 Whisper of Dread – Emits a frequency-based whistle that causes intense psychological distress, hallucinations, and fear in both dragons and humans. Prolonged exposure can induce trauma or hysteria.

🦷 Bone Shiver Display – When threatened, the Death Whistle can manipulate its fur and skin pigment to exaggerate its skeletal patterns, creating a terrifying illusion of death incarnate.

🧠 Night-Thinking – Exceptionally intelligent. Can mimic sounds, recognize patterns, and solve complex problems. Has a known capacity for empathy and self-sacrifice — but only toward bonded individuals.

🐾 Shadowstep – Its paw-pads and claws are covered in vibration-dampening fibers, allowing it to move silently across almost any terrain. Hunters often report being killed without ever hearing it approach.

Vocalizations Roar: None 

Primary Sound: A deafening whisper — a high-pitched, breathy whistle that mimics thousands of faint voices.

This sound isn’t vocalized in the traditional sense. Instead, the Death Whistle breathes through hollow, flute-like structures in its sinuses and throat, generating an echoing susurrus that grows louder the closer it is. This sound has been reported to cause:

Disorientation

Nausea

Temporary deafness

Nightmares (when heard during sleep)

Memory blackouts in rare cases

The closer a Death Whistle is, the softer its sound becomes, until — in lethal encounters — there is total silence. This trait has given rise to the phrase:

""If you can hear the whistle, you're still alive.""

Fun Fact: Despite its terrifying demeanor, the Death Whistle is extremely protective of orphaned creatures. Some are rumored to guard graveyards or lost children’s camps, warding off threats with terrifying vocalizations while never striking the innocent.",Striker-Fan2008,Reddit,Positive,0.11159072871572874
2023-04-30 13:29:59,"Immaturity in the Watts Home Clearly, SW and CW were not a good match. 

One of the things I haven't seen discussed much is the arrested development of the Watts adults. 

Not everyone is a Rhodes Scholar or a member of The Finer Things Club. No judgement. 

SW and CW rarely seemed to do *anything* as a couple or as individuals for personal growth, besides CWs exercise kick at the end. 

*Romantic dinners out?*  During these, SW would continue to network with Thrivers, doing three way calls and being on Facebook. 

*Trips with the kids?*  Much more about getting the perfect photo and the proper Facebook tags and check ins. Their trips with the kids seemed more photo shoot than fun family time. The Christmas video, for example. 

*Reading?*  I never saw an adults book in the house. Not once, unless you count *Hold me Tight*. 

*Hiking, biking, skiing?*  Colorado is gorgeous. There are a ton of beautiful areas nearby. Never once saw the Watts children or SW outside in nature. 

*Cultural events?*  Denver, very close to Frederick, is a melting pot of cultures and has endless opportunities. 

I saw a lot of time and money spent on MLM products. A lot of time and effort spent on Facebook, keeping up with the Joneses. A lot of money wasted on Level lifestyle getaways. Even more wasted on the latest gadget to show off, an Apple Watch, an Amazon Echo. Not to mention, all the thrive samples she sent out SW paid for. The company didn't provide those. 

Their children hadn't *ever* been on a vacation with Mom and Dad before SW and CW started jetting off to their cringy ""all inclusives"" with the MLMers. 

Are there any videos of SW engaging with Bella and Cece on their terms, not hers? I haven't seen any. 

SW liked to preach to people how to live their life. As a sales and marketing technique, it's effective. The problem is, she started to believe it herself while not continuing to work on growing as a person. In her head, she had ""made it"". She had life figured out, as long as everyone around her did exactly as she ordered. 

She talked the talked to her Facebook followers but didn't walk the walk when it came time to be good to her family. She lived on buzzwords and Facebook quotes. She preached treating others a certain way but treated those closest to her with annoyance and contempt. She forgot who was important, the people right there in her household. Instead, she treated them as a burden. To her, her family lived to serve her purposes. 

Without a strong educational or experience driven values system, SW and CW were in an arrested state of development. There was no emphasis placed on personal or relationship growth. 

A great example of this can be seen in the summer of 2018.

SW has cash available for every Thrive convention. She flies to the Scottsdale ""local"" on her dime. She gets her nails done at a salon multiple times in North Carolina. 

Yet, when Christina Meacham suggests couples counseling to communicate and find a way forward, SW laments they ""can't afford it"". 

***Priorities.***

There are hundreds of videos of their interactions. Lots of discussion available including private texts. I realized that rarely, if ever, are new or unique subjects discussed. It is the same words and subjects repeated over and over. 

1) Thrive promotion
2) Kids are (<insert blank> sick, wild, monsters) 
3) Tell kids to say hi to phone
4) vapid motivational jargon (take that leap of faith, you only have to impress yourself, I am 12k)
5) state of the house (kids are sleeping, Chris should be home soon, I need to pack for Punta Cana) 

That's basically it. 


They communicated at a high school level. As SW liked to say, she ""played Mom"". She took her high school job of a stage director and tried to direct her own reality. They never sat down and worked out a budget, even after declaring bankruptcy. 

A mere 2 years after bankruptcy, while he spends his days working full time outside in the heat, SW tells CW she needs 10k from their retirement to pay the back mortgage. She hadn't paid it in 3 months nor told him. 

She was ""investing in the business"" and CW needed to support her dream. He did, no questions asked. 
CW worked a job where he had to dig a hole if he needed to use the restroom. That isn't fun. He should have put his foot down. He never did, not once. He buried his head in the sand, then acted like an innocent. Doesn't work that way, dude. 

SW pretended that if CW didn't call her out, it meant it was okay. She *knew* she treated him poorly. She bragged about it in Livestreams, even. She *knew* he didn't like being treated that way. She justified it by saying he didn't call her now out. When she would get mad, she would throw public jabs on Facebook. ""Vague booking"", they call it. 

CW allowed SW to dictate his entire life. He allowed that. 

CW and SW amplified each other's worst qualities. They regressed to their worst versions of themselves with each other's influences. 

In a healthy relationship, the participants grow as individuals and as a couple. 

Reflection and honest discussion can do a lot.",HurricaneBetsy,Reddit,Positive,0.13502717340379683
2023-04-08 18:03:13,"The cost of five minutes “Healer! Healer!” Men rushed into the tent again, urgently shouting, followed by the stretcher-bearers.

&#x200B;

Ufrantus was used to this already, these few years of war had hardened her for these situations, and she replied with a loud but clamer voice, over the consistent screams and shouts in the packed field hospital.

“Here, put him down here!”

The group of human warriors and camp followers helped the stretcher-bearers to slowly put down the patient on a makeshift operating table, still bloody from the last patient.

It was a young Servannian knight, barely over his twenties, his helmet was already removed, and from the state of his armour and face she knew things were terrible: The previously gold-ornated steel had now been battered to scrap metal, his right pauldron was gone, exposing a few strands of fabrics that were once his arming doublet and the shoulder underneath was a bloody mess.

&#x200B;

his face was an unhealthy pale and covered in terrific wounds, lips darkened, blood was seeping out of his nose and mouth with every weak breath.

&#x200B;

“Specific condition?” She asked as she checked his pulse, half knowing the answer already.

&#x200B;

Through the panting voice, one of his retinues answered, “Quicksilver poisoning.”

&#x200B;

*The ninth one she had seen today.*

&#x200B;

“Please, do what you can to save our lord.”The squire pleaded.

&#x200B;

A sudden surge of rage almost overcame Ufrantus, her hands clutched into a fist, attempting her best to contain it.

&#x200B;

“I will. Now get out, all of you. You will only get in the way.”

&#x200B;

“But…”

&#x200B;

“Out now! I don’t have time for this nor does your master.”

&#x200B;

With reluctance, the group of retinue left.

&#x200B;

Ufrantus began to shout out orders for her assistants, everyone was quick-paced. There was no time for delicacy now, they had to cut the leather armour strips first to treat the physical wound, and by the looks of the battered armour and blood leaking from the armour joints, it must be bad. At the same time, Ufrantus prepared the proper healing spells and potions for detoxification, with quicksilver poisoning every second counts.

&#x200B;

When they finally cut loose his armour and removed the cuirass, even Ufrantus gasped. His body was covered in every wound possible: cuts, tears, bruises, dislocations, broken bones and burns. Not to mention heat stroke from continuous fighting in a suit of metal.

&#x200B;

Ufrantus could not imagine what he had been through, whatever hell this knight had endured and survived.

She immediately begin chanting the required spells to stop the bleeding, while her assistant tried to clean the wound to assist with the healing and feed the knight water and an anti-toxin potion.

&#x200B;

But nothing was working, the young knight’s wounds were too severe, the quicksilver had likely done too much damage to his body for it to heal, even with the best Kirithian healing magic and potions. His pulse and breath grew weaker with every moment that passed.

&#x200B;

“No, no, no, no, stay with me, you human bastard.” Ufrantus muttered under her breath, “I’m not letting you die here, not after whatever hell you have come through.”

&#x200B;

Ufrantus stood closer, putting her hands closer to his body, pouring more mana and psychic focus onto her chants, hoping that the healing magic will drag the young human knight back from the gates of Death.

&#x200B;

Suddenly, the young knight took Ufrantus by surprise and grabbed her arm, with the strength that a dying human should not have, he dragged Ufrantus closer to himself and spoke.

&#x200B;

“Where…where are the Kirithians, did…did the civilians… did they retreat successfully?”

&#x200B;

He struggled with every word, wheezing breath between his weak speech.

&#x200B;

“Yes, yes they did,” Ufrantus put her other hand on his and answered, “You should rest now, you have suffered terrible wounds.”

&#x200B;

“Good…good…” The edge of his mouth jerked slightly upwards as he relax his head back, his brows no longer twitching with pain. The young knight’s voice slowly faded away with a relieved and satisfied tone.

And then, his breath ceased.

&#x200B;

The grip on Ufrantus’s forearm loosened, the human’s hand slowly slipped away, and his arm dropped down the edge of the makeshift operating table.

&#x200B;

======================

Ufrantus sat by the bank of the small river around the camp, her shift had ended and she was relieved by another Healer Prima. She was tired, but she could not bring herself to rest.

&#x200B;

She looked down and slowly rubbed her right forearm, though the finger marks had long since faded, the gripping sensation of the young human knight still lingered.

&#x200B;

""Grand Healer Ufrantus"" It was the human Surgeon Aegineta, she was exhausted as well, with the same fatigued and bloodied face that Ufrantus had seen many times.

&#x200B;

“Mind if I sit here too?”

Ufrantus shook her head and turned back toward the river again.

Aegineta sat down slowly and with a grunt. She rubbed her hands together, trying to formulate something to say, and eventually, she let out a deep breath and spoke.

&#x200B;

“I’ve heard about Sir Bayard. You’ve done your best, do not feel bad about it.”

&#x200B;

Ufrantus knew the surgeon was merely trying to comfort her, and she was grateful about it. But that odd sense of anger began to creep up again. And she couldn’t help herself but to ask.

“Why do you let them use it?”

&#x200B;

“I beg your pardon?” The human surgeon's head turned,  her expression clearly confused.

&#x200B;

“The quicksilver, why do you let them use it?” Ufrantus repeated again, this time with a bit more agitation.

&#x200B;

“No one let them use it,"" The surgeon answered, with an awkward chuckle, ""They are knights, they let themselves use whatever they want.”

&#x200B;

“But did you not warn them about it? That it will kill them?”

&#x200B;

“Oh I did, we all did, in fact, every scholar did. But they do not care."" Though this explanation did not quite quell Ufrantus’ anger, it did shock her.

&#x200B;

“Listen, grand healer. You might think of us as war-mongering lunatics that have no regard for ourselves or our people.” The human surgeon’s tone began to become more serious. And she turned her whole body towards Ufrantus, looking her directly in the eyes.

&#x200B;

“We have no magic of your kind, the dexterity of the elves, the strength of the giants nor the sorcery of the Kopruns. We are human, and what we are is what we have. And whatever we can utilise, we will do so. This is how we survive, this is how we win wars.”

&#x200B;

“These knights came to fight for your people because they believe it is righteous and just. And they will do whatever it takes to win, as it is the only way.”

&#x200B;

***“Whatever it takes, no matter the cost.”***

&#x200B;

======================

**5 hours ago, River Kaflar.**

&#x200B;

“Sir Bayard! Sir Bayard! Maestro Sparr has ordered a general retreat, the left had disintegrated, the Tercio can’t hold them!”

&#x200B;

“What of the refugees? The Kirithians have not finished the crossing yet!” Sir Bayard of De’mar asked, meanwhile casually dispatching a Koprun Kataphract with his pollaxe.

&#x200B;

“The Maestro said we can’t risk the entire Tercio, whoever is left only the Saints can save them now!” The messenger answered in haste, then gave a quick salute and rode off, racing to relay the order.

&#x200B;

*Damn*, Bayard muttered under his breath.

&#x200B;

Tercio *di La Muraglia d'Acciaio* had been engaged in battle for more than five hours nonstop, just to keep the Kaflar bridgehead open for Kirithians refugees to retreat, now that they were so close to salvation, their saviour would abandon them to their fates.

&#x200B;

*This cannot do, I will not bear this shame, to abandon the innocent to these savages.*

&#x200B;

“Master Galio, tell me how much time I have left for the runes?” The knight turned to his mage retinue.

&#x200B;

“Sir, I must warn you that if you…”

&#x200B;

But before the mage could finish his protest, the young knight interrupted him. “Just tell me how much time!”

&#x200B;

The mage retinue reach out his hand and placed it on Sir Bayard’s armour, momentarily closing his eyes to concentrate.

&#x200B;

“My liege, you have approximately one hour left with this amount of quicksilver, but I must insist Sir, that prolonged usage of …”

&#x200B;

“Will kill me, I am aware Master Galio.”

&#x200B;

The runic circuit activated, the runes etched in old Servannian and linear circuit glowed. Sir Bayard could feel power pulsing through him as mana flowed throughout the armour, accompanied with a metallic sweetness in his mouth.

&#x200B;

“Master Galio, tell the batteries under no circumstances they should stop firing and retreat unless the final line of the *Spadone Veterano* had failed. And inform the Maestro I will buy the time for the refugees.”

&#x200B;

His retinues bowed and hurried to their orders. There were no farewell words, they need none of such things.

&#x200B;

Bayard lowered his visor and readied his pollaxe.

&#x200B;

*Here we go then.*

&#x200B;

With a kick that shook the ground, he propelled himself into a great leap, crossing a hundred pace within seconds and smashed into a densely packed Koprunite formation.

The impact killed a dozen men outright, the rest blew away like dolls. Sir Bayard swung his pollaxe with augmented strength, the hammerhead caved in armour and turned Koprun flesh into tenderised meat and mushed paste.

&#x200B;

Then something hit, immense heat was what Bayard felt first, followed by the concussive blow. Something with the strength of a bull impacted his and knocked the wind out of him, the taste of metallic sweetness in his mouth felt stronger, now with the addition of blood.

&#x200B;

He must keep moving, he must buy time for the retreat, five more minutes, just five more minutes will do.

&#x200B;

His legs were still moving, pushing him forward. The armour must have held and the Runes were still functional, feeding both the armour and him power.

&#x200B;

Ignoring the clang of arrows uselessly glancing off his armour, Bayard concentrated through his narrow visor, trying to locate the source of the attack.

&#x200B;

He caught the glimpse of red light with the corner of his vision slit, he instinctively blocked with his pollaxe, years of training kicked in as muscle memory took over. The pollaxe exploded in splinters of wood and steel shards.

&#x200B;

It was a group of mages, two hundred paces away, already chanting for the next attack spell.

Then the ground around their position erupted, throwing up dirt and pink mist, body parts flaked around as Servannian hunter-killer gun batteries' precisely executed their anti-sorcerer tactics. But the salvo did not kill them all, there's one left.

&#x200B;

With a roar Bayard threw the broken shaft in his hand, the air boomed as it accelerated towards his target. The wooden pole impacted the shield bearers guarding the mage and smashed right through them, sent them flying then hit the chanting mage with so much force his body was ripped in half.

&#x200B;

There was no pause between his movement, Sir Bayard was already moving. He drew his blade and leapt forward again, curving his way through iron and sinew.

&#x200B;

***Just five more minutes.***

&#x200B;

Elite Kataphracts and Yanizar guards came for him, axe blades and mace flashing with armour-piercing sorcery, specifically to counter a fully armoured human knight.

*Good, he had caught the attention of the enemy now.*

Steel clashed and blows were exchanged, rings and metal flakes flew in all directions as enchanted chainmail and lamellar were bashed through with sheer brute force, Sir Bayard gripped his longsword on the blade, using its crossguard and pommel as a temporary hammer as cuts were of little effect.

&#x200B;

***Just five more minutes.***

&#x200B;

These creatures were but crude imitations of him. Heavily armoured head to toe and went through vigorous training for sure. But they were no knights. Sir Bayard was born into war, his sole purpose was war, to them this was an occupation, to him, this is what he was made for, it was part of his nature as if breathing air.

But he was but one, and they were many.

And the poison began to drag him down. Bayard forgot when he lost the sense of smell and taste, nor the sensation of pain. His hands were numb, and he struggled to breathe and had to consistently fight against the urge to remove this helm.

&#x200B;

***Just five more minutes.***

&#x200B;

The Golem towered over him, with strength that could shatter fortress walls it's giant rocky digits curled into a fist and swung, it caught Sir Bayard in the right shoulder as he attempted to dogde the blow, it sent him flying, whirled in the air and crashed into the ground.

There was no pain, but a sense of tiredness dragged Bayard down as if something dropped a mountain over him. His body was so heavy, his armour was so heavy, his eye lids were so heavy. His mind was murky and he could not even comprehend the ringing in his ears anymore.

&#x200B;

*Where am I ? I am tired.....I must...must rest......*

&#x200B;

**NO!**

&#x200B;

The slam of the golem's feet snapped him awake, **""I MUST FIGHT!""**

&#x200B;

Bayard could not sense his right arm anymore, broken? cut away? And his vision was a mix of blurred images, but It does not matter, now he must stand! To stand and fight!

He clenched his teeth and attempted to push his body up, the runic circuit no long glowed as brightly and struggled to push the battered armour and broken knight up.

*Move Bayard! You must move! If you will not fight who will fight? If you do not stand who will stand? You are the exemplar! You are the bastion! You must fight for those who can't! You are a* ***KNIGHT***!

He roared and lifted himself up, staggering in the process. His blade was no longer with him so he drew the dagger.

&#x200B;

***Just five more minutes.***

&#x200B;

The world was grey and silent.

&#x200B;

Bayard laid beside the golem’s head, his dagger embedded deep in its face.

&#x200B;

He could no longer move, truly this time, he felt weightless yet heavy, as if his body no longer belonged to himself. The heat that burnt him slowly died down, and it started to get colder and colder. And although, the sensation of pain slowly slipped back, oddly not to the degree that was unbearable.

&#x200B;

A small breeze blew across his face. He did not know when his visor was smashed away, or perhaps he opened it himself? He did not remember, actually,  he could not remember many things.

&#x200B;

But one thing, one question did linger in his mind. Did the refugees cross the river? He hoped that they did. He hope the Maestro of the Tercio did listen to his retinues. He hoped he had done enough. He hoped he did buy them enough time.

&#x200B;

***Just five more minutes.***

&#x200B;

Darkness slowly crept up from the corners of his eyes. Bayard tried to fight it, but his mind had begun to drift as well. He could not focus anymore.

&#x200B;

*Then, darkness.*

2024-07-10 11:08:40,"Challenging the Claim of Yasuke's Status as a Samurai # Introduction

The current academic consensus on the classification of samurai during the Sengoku Jidai (Warring States period) posits that many individuals, including commoners, peasants, bandits, and ashigaru, were elevated to the status of samurai by being appointed to permanent roles within a retinue. This approach is based on the historical necessity to explain the significant social mobility during a period of societal collapse. This report critically examines the prescriptive nature of this consensus, particularly in the context of Yasuke, an African retainer of Oda Nobunaga.

# Historical Context and Academic Consensus

The term ""samurai"" was in use before and after the Sengoku Jidai. Historical records indicate that numerous individuals of lower social classes were transformed into samurai in the same manner as Yasuke, by being appointed as permanent retainers. Since these individuals were not given specific titles but were recorded as full retainers, the current consensus assumes them to be samurai, defining them as permanent professional warriors irrespective of their origins.

# Yasuke's Classification as a Samurai

Yasuke's classification as a samurai has been a subject of debate. Many scholars argue that his role, duties, and the respect he commanded justify this classification. However, this conclusion is criticized for its prescriptive methodology, which relies on predefined criteria rather than a thorough analysis of historical evidence.

# Prescriptive vs. Descriptive Historiography

1. **Assumption of Roles**: The assumption that Yasuke and others without specific titles were samurai overlooks historical complexities. The argument that ""since they are not given any specific title, yet appear as permanent retainers, they must be samurai"" is a leap that fails to consider other potential roles within the retinue.
2. **Cultural and Social Context**: A descriptive approach would consider the unique cultural and social context of Yasuke’s time. As an African, Yasuke held a distinctive position in Nobunaga’s court, potentially making his role special or honorary rather than fitting the traditional samurai mold.
3. **Diverse Roles and Social Mobility**: The fluid social structure of the Sengoku Jidai allowed for significant role mobility. While Yasuke’s duties might align with those of samurai, this does not definitively place him within the samurai class. A descriptive analysis would examine Yasuke’s specific duties, interactions, and treatment by contemporaries without immediate categorization.

# The Need for Rigorous Evidence

To move beyond prescriptive assumptions, a more rigorous evidence-based approach is necessary:

1. **Detailed Analysis of Historical Sources**: Primary sources should be examined to gain a better understanding of Yasuke’s unique position. This includes how contemporaries documented his presence and roles.
2. **Alternative Interpretations**: Considering that Yasuke might have held a unique or honorary status distinct from traditional samurai offers a different perspective. His role could have been tailored to his unique background, granting him certain privileges without formally classifying him as a samurai.
3. **Philosophical Skepticism**: Adopting a skeptical approach to historical knowledge acknowledges the limitations and potential biases in available sources. This openness to multiple interpretations avoids settling on one prescriptive narrative.

# Conclusion

The classification of Yasuke as a samurai based on prescriptive assumptions is open to significant challenge. By adopting a more descriptive and evidence-based approach, historians can better understand Yasuke's unique position in Nobunaga's retinue. This approach respects the complexities of historical contexts and avoids oversimplified categorizations based on incomplete or biased records. Ultimately, it emphasizes the need for intellectual humility and rigorous examination before drawing definitive conclusions about historical figures like Yasuke.

# Summary Statement

In response to the question, ""Was Yasuke a samurai?"" the most concise answer is: ""Yasuke likely held a role similar to a samurai, but his exact status is still debated among historians.""

# Critique of Current Interpretations

Much of the information about Yasuke, especially from popular sources like Wikipedia, contains inaccuracies. Historian Thomas Lockley’s work, while influential, often involves assumptions and creative liberties rather than solid facts. For example, Lockley's book mentions an alleged oral history about Yasuke creating a death mask for Nobunaga, a claim unsupported by concrete evidence.

Lockley's dissertation suggests that Yasuke might have held a warrior status, but the concept of samurai as a distinct caste was not solidified in his time. His assertion that Yasuke was addressed as ""Tono"" and carried Nobunaga’s weapons lacks corroborating sources.

# Conclusion

The classification of Yasuke as a samurai remains debated. While some sources, like Lockley’s works, assert his samurai status, this conclusion is not universally accepted. Reliable sources only mention Yasuke in a few battles, and his exact skills and status are unclear. A rigorous, descriptive approach to historical evidence is necessary to gain a more accurate understanding of Yasuke's role in Nobunaga’s court.",shoshinsha00,Reddit,Positive,0.13312030075187972

# FAQ:

^(If an answer was helpful to you, please click the reference link and give that person an upvote and a ty!)

* **Can anyone explain the timeline? So, everything happened before 500 years ago or after the cataclysm. Now, what is the cataclysm here? Is it the Khaenriah one? So, was the previous Fontaine civilization destroyed during the cataclysm or what? Or this same civilization was there at that time? I am confused cause I didn't pay attention because one of the quests mentioned a previous civilization. So, were Alain, Mary Ann & were part of the current civilization or the previous one? So, were they experimenting on the previous civilization's fall? Any speculation if the other sibling was also related to those events somehow because at the end a dialogue talks about a blond outlander before and another blond traveller?**

(1)  The Narzissenkreuz crew were part of the current civilization. They were little kids around the time of the Khaenri'ah cataclysm 500 years ago. The ""previous civilization,"" Remuria, is somewhat ambiguous timeline-wise but it seems like it was pre-Archon War. \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8z0gth/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

(2) Remuria was definitively around during the Archon War, not before. It's said to have arisen after the time of Gurabad, but the age of Gurabad itself took place after the death of the Goddess of Flowers. This would have been after Rukkhadevata was already Dendro Archon, as she received the Gnosis while the three still ruled together. \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8zvwf3/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

* **What are the implications given by the Narzissenkreuz quests?**

The implication given by the Narzissenkreuz quests is that the apocalypse was only averted due to the presence of a previously unknown variable- that is, the Traveler. Rene's world formula was proven to be fairly accurate, predicting the cause of the apocalypse (a beast from the stars devouring the amniotic sea) and even when it would occur almost to the day. But his world formula was calculated without any knowledge of the Traveler, who was sealed at the time: an outside variable that would change the outcome. This is to say, had the Traveler not been present, Rene's world formula calculated that the apocalypse would have occurred. We can already see at the end of the quest that Neuvillette alone was not sufficient to defeat the Whale, and Focalors despite her brilliant gambit didn't actually know about the Whale's existence. \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8xwb00/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

&#x200B;

* **Why does Narzissenkreuz say he miscalculated the world formula?**

The thing is that Narzissenkreuz can sense the values that have changed since his world formula was first put into motion, which he mentions in his dialogue. While he acknowledges that his formula is no longer precisely correct, he attributes the failure of his calculations pretty specifically to the Traveler as a new variable, not those altered values. Given what he notes, it is the Traveler's intervention in the formula specifically that caused the result to change drastically. This follows with previous lore we received on the world formula, as the entire reason Rene first pursued the Abyss as an avenue of research was because as something from outside of this world, it presented the greatest chance at being a variable that could change the calculated result. Narzissenkreuz's ultimate folly wasn't in his logic, but in his delusional presumption that he was fit to save the world. As far as his hard math was concerned, he was as right as he could have been. \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8z548s/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

&#x200B;

* **Does the verbiage Rene uses to describe his miscalculation change based on if you have done the archon quest?**

His dialogue if you already completed the main story elaborates on what he means. When he talks about someone taking control of the life-force (likely the Primordial Sea) and someone opening the beast-realm (likely the Abyss), they are values that have shifted, not new variables. The actual new variable is the Traveler. In his words:

>**Narzissenkreuz:** I should have sensed the changes in the values originally entered into the world-formula. A ""variable"" has descended upon this world.  
>  
>**Narzissenkreuz:** Not everything from outside the universe can be called a ""presence"" or ""variable.""  
>  
>**Narzissenkreuz:** But it seems I overlooked one nonetheless. You.  
>  
>**Narzissenkreuz:** The witness of all, the recorder of all, the designer of all.  
>  
>**Narzissenkreuz:** Only one who is worth a world can bear that title.  
>  
>**Narzissenkreuz:** I once dreamed of becoming one just like you. But that dream is now shattered.

Not every individual, even if they are from outside this world, can qualify as a new variable. It's specifically the Traveler, due to their own inherent significance as someone who is ""worth a world"" that qualifies as such. \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8z3jrs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

If you haven't, then it becomes:

>**Narzissenkreuz:** Indeed, I can sense changes in the values originally entered into the world-formula.  
>  
>**Narzissenkreuz:** Someone has seized control of the life-force, and someone has opened the beast-realm.  
>  
>**Narzissenkreuz:** And then, there is one more variable. That is you.  
>  
>**Narzissenkreuz:** The person fated to see the all-consuming whale put to flight. The one who shall witness all.  
>  
>**Narzissenkreuz:** I see, I see.

Essentially he adjusts his formula to account for the new variable and can now see that the Traveler is destined to defeat the whale. \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8zz962/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

&#x200B;

* **Can anyone explain who this Mr. Eliphas that we can fight after the Narzissenkreuz quest ends is? I remember seeing his name in a note somewhere.**

The note is at the bottom of the Tower of Gestalt. Off the top of my head, Eliphas was an Ordo follower/member who invented the hydro traversal method (the one that’s a circle with a line pointing to where it takes you and turns you into water). He was absorbed and turned into Tainted Hydro Phantasm for the sake of Narzissenkreuz (Lyris+Rene+all the other victims from the Ordo). \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8sk5rh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

* [Log](https://ambr.top/en/archive/book/120784/log)\- this is the interactable found by the sunflower at the end of this quest. It is a **MUST** read.

* Explanation of the log provided by u/LexAurelia, thank you so much!
   * The author of the log is Jakob. After the experiments to save Carter from his disease gone wrong, his consciousness was placed into a Hilichurl's body, which is the character we know as Caterpillar. Could be that Cater was his nickname to begin with, or it could be that they began to refer to him this way after the experiments, obsessed with the idea of saving him, getting the caterpillar to turn into a butterfly. The Puppy you meet in ??? is also what remains of Carter's consciousness, literally what the log refers to ""Cater's remains"". ""I'm just a memory that they have of their friend"" he says, and ""The butterfly became a cocoon, and a larva emerged from the cocoon. Then the larva returned to the void that was never born"", which is what Caterpillar has said previously. I think this refers to the whole process of what happened to him. If we read into it more, it's quite possible that the Puppy isn't just a ""memory"" but in fact what's left of the monster that Carter turned into as result of the first experiment, which is why the Puppy can be perceived differently and which is why he repeatedly asked the Traveler about how he appears to them. \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8x0ax9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]
* Additional explanation of the log provided by u/Xyolex  thank you so much!
   * Rene's own ego seemed to have collapsed after he ""ascended"" (what this means is unclear), and as such Jakob had to find another method to bring him back. Funnily enough, there were a few books scattered around the tower that showed some of the Ordo's methods of divination, and one woman in specific had found that Rene was dead, but all of the other groups' findings disagreed with her; It's reasonable to infer that she was actually correct here given Jakob\`s admission in the Log.
   * Secondly, Jakob refers a lot to the attempts to bring Carter back to life, they get pieces of his body, then put them in the basin, then produce oceanid-human bodies that resemble humans, rinse and repeat, but consider this: They never actually got Carter back, all they have are his memories. (The dog inside the Book confirms this). As such, and given the eventual birth of Caterpillar, it may seem that the Ordo actually \*clones people based on their memories\* as opposed to bringing them back to life. As in, they create life, but cannot give it back. If this is true, then it implies that the Narzissenkreuz that Jakob ""revives"" at the end of the log is actually just a copy, cleansed of the memories of his ""two previous failures"", made by Jakob in the image of his dead friend.
   * Lastly, the book. In the 4.1 quests, Caterpillar goes in-depth about the powers of the Sword of Narzissenkreuz to bring ""imagination to reality"", and it is my belief that the world inside of the Book is that imaginary world. It is seen in entirely different forms by Caterpillar, the traveler, and Canotila, and the Dog inside that world seems to believe as such as well and is self-aware of his status as the person that they (Rene and Jakob) tried to save, that being Carter. It is even possible that this version of Carter is, by itself, just imagination. Made by Rene/Jakob's memories and subsequently chased by them for representing the ideal of saving Carter. And if that was the case, then Rene would become that ideal for Jakob later on, both of them already being dead for a long time. \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k92b2xn/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

* **Did we kill Caterpillar? In the very last fight to save Canotila?**

Caterpillar's most likely fine, as he thanks you for something Paimon doesn't understand in it. Most likely he's thanking you for getting him out of the book's imaginary world. \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8zwtlk/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

* **Not a question; a good call out from** u/calico197

Somehow I didn't notice that Pahsiv was vishap backwards. Interestingly, that doesn't seem to be the case with her CN name and the CN vishap term which don't seem to have anything in common aside from two characters sharing a pronunciation (西 in 珀西芙 and 蜥 in 龙蜥). I kind of wonder if her original name 珀西芙 (Pò xī fú ) was meant to reference Percival from Arthurian legend (which is 珀西瓦里). I just though it was neat. \[[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8ukznv/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)\]

* **I guess it's not a big surprise that Pahsiv is a vishap right? and that the ""visitor"" she mentions is Neuvi. my guess is that the Willow is an intact irminsul branch of sorts? and neuvi is maintaining it? \[**[reference](https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Lore/comments/17rhp43/comment/k8oo88v/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)**\]**

Love and Longing

“... I was not ready for today.” Amara’Gorr, a distant cousin to officer Finri’Gorr states. Granted it’s a fair statement considering she’s standing in a place that is also a living creature that has influenced the history and legends of her people for time immemorial, and likely has personally lived longer than her entire species has existed.

“Is it that you’re in The Dark Forest that’s doing it?” Vernon asks as he take a sip of a nice hot broth that Miro’Noir and he had made together.

“No, I actually had a borderline prophetic dream about that recently. Well... a nightmare, but I’d like to think that prepared me for it.”

“Why would you have nightmares about this place?” Vernon asks capping the drink and then considering. He then gestures and a stone launches itself from the ground and into his hand. It then immediately reshapes itself into a large mug and he smiles at the inspector. “Care for some broth? It’s home made just this morning.”

She just stares at him for a moment before coughing into her fist and straightening out an imaginary wrinkle in her suit.

“No, I... I am fine. I ate quite well and absurdity aside, this inspection should be over before lunch.”

“Of course.”

“Now, as I understand it, the caretaker is also the location where the children will be staying.” Amara’Gorr states before scrunching her eyes together for a moment. “Which is a fascinating situation, but the point stands that it is going to be very difficult to actually speak with and interview The Forest itself.”

“We have a solution.” Vernon states.

“Somehow I am not surprised.” Amara’Gorr states blandly.

“We’ve been practising something, The Forest’s mind is vast after all and while it’s capable of many things, quick communication is a little bit tough for it.” Vernon states clearly.

“A point against it I’m afraid, clear communication between caretaker and child is very important.” Amara’Gorr says and Vernon nods.

“Well, not only can it speak through it’s sons, and speak clearly to the three sorcerers-to-be in the ranks of the children. But as I said, we have a solution. If you’ll follow me a few steps madam. It’s just behind this house.”

“I have a feeling that whatever it is that I’m going to see is going to leave me in a state where I will be unfit to examine the buildings. So if we could get that out of the way first?”

“Of course, The Forest is patient after all.” Vernon agrees.

“Thank you.” She says. “Now, I am unfamiliar with this architectural style. Is the building solid?”

“The framework is extremely solid.” Vernon replies as he gives one of the support beams a solid kick. “Without Axiom use they’re rated for more or less constant low level earthquakes and very impressive storms. Which means that with the sheer tectonic stability of this area and the shelter of the Forest itself around us that this building is rock solid even without the sheer amount of Axiom running through it.”

“And with the Axiom?”

“Fireproof, waterproof, windproof, insect and animal proof. You could bombard this from orbit with city destroyer lasers and while the ground around it will be cooked fairly thoroughly, the building itself will maintain a cool and comfortable temperature throughout the entire performance, even in the heart of the barrage.” Vernon states confidently.

“And the lights? Running water? Interior heating? Furniture?”

“Come on in and see.” Vernon says as he slides open the door. “Although with this style of house it’s polite to remove your outdoor footwear when entering.”

“Tradition?”

“This house is built in the style of the homeland of one of our more prominent and skilled Sorcerers. He’s Japanese and this is in the Feudal Japanese style. So we’re being respectful.”

“You value respect?”

“If good manners can stop people from getting hurt, be it physically or emotionally, then good manners should be encouraged. And they do, so they will be.” Vernon states as he slips out of his shoes. He’s in a business formal outfit, minus the jacket so slacks, vest, button up shirt and formal shoes. Or rather socks now.

Amara’Gorr follows him in after removing her own flats and she sniffs the air. “Cooking?”

“Snacks for the children.” Vernon answers.

“Come on over! These are good cold, but you can never beat fresh off the grill!” Dale calls out from the kitchen area. Amara follows her nose over to the area and outright smiles at the sight of Dale turning over some strips of meat on a grill. “Welcome to the kitchen ma’am, where the larder is full to bursting and we have enough for an entire platoon of gluttons.”

“Really? Then you don’t mind if I poke around a bit?”

“Be my guest.” Dale replies and she quickly strides past him and turns on the sink. She blinks in surprise as fresh cool water pours out. She sticks a finger in and then tastes it.

“Mountain spring water?” She asks before turning off the cold and then turning on the hot. It warms up quickly and she tastes it as well. “Very clever. If you don’t mind, could I fill a bottle with this? Water this fresh and sweet is normally something you have to pay a premium for.”

“Go ahead.” Dale says before holding out a canteen he summoned. “Here, have an extra so you can have it all officially tested to your satisfaction.”

“Oh? So you don’t mind?”

“Not at all.” Dale replies and she fills up a water bottle with a device on the side and then the canteen. She activates the device and examines it for a moment. Her eyebrows go up. “Well, seeing as how you have what chemically seems to be fresh Queen’s Delight bottled water out of the tap I’m going to give this a pass. An envious one as I have to pay a fair amount for water this good.”

She then takes a deep drink of the water in question. “Oh my. That is VERY good.”

“Care to examine the larder?” An amused Dale asks.

“Yes it would be... obviously the door labelled Larder in Galactic Trade, Cindertongue, Classical Cindertongue and two more languages I don’t recognize.”

“Japanese and English.” Vernon supplies.

“I see...”

“English is kind of like the Galactic Trade of Earth, if it was made by complete accident.”

“And Japanese is the language that shares it’s history with this kind of building. I understand.” She says before opening the larder. “Clear preservation markings on every shelf to prevent decay, and insect and microbe warding arrays as well. Very good, I see.... an enormous amount of Paratak.”

“Delicious, nutritious and very numerous locally.” Dale offers.

“You have the standard cuts of meat, good. Bones for stewing and chewing. Organ meat for the nutritious centrepieces of the meal and you’ve even kept jars of rendered fat and blood for the thickening of soups and stews. Aren’t you omnivores?”

“Yes, which is why it was so hard to resist putting in bushels of fruits and loads of grains and vegetables in there too.” Dale remarks. “Does it hold up to standard?”

“Hmm, while it has less variety than some pantries I’ve seen the sheer fullness of it certainly compensates. I’m going to note down that a larger variety of meats should be included. Fish and fowl are important parts of the diet. But Paratak is a fine meat.” She says before looking around the room. “Do you have locks for the cupboards? Some of the children are quite small and could rifle through them and draw a knife.”

“Try and open one.” Dale offers and she raises an eyebrow but complies. It doesn’t open.

“Are these just decorative?” She asks before Vernon answers by stepping around her and wordlessly opening it for her. Inside is a number of forks, knives, spoons and chopsticks. “I see. What kind of locking mechanism is this? Is it child safe?”

“It’s only unsafe to a trained sorcerer. For these drawers you need the direct approval of The Woods to open and it defaults to no unless you know how to ask.”

“And how long does it take to establish that level of communication with The Dark Forest?” Amara’Gorr asks.

“For a child? Years. For a grown adult? Minutes at most.” Vernon answers and Amara nods.

“I see.” She says as she takes out a communicator and quickly taps in some things. “Well, you have food and kitchen safety covered. Next I need to see the bedrooms and then bathrooms.”

“Of course, it’s just upstairs.” Vernon says with a smile.

He shows her to the stairs and she runs her hand over the railing and gives it a few random shakes and stomps a bit on the steps up. She finds nothing amiss and continues on.

“Interesting bedding, is this also in the Japanese style?”

“Yes, the Futon is designed to be folded up and packed away with ease. It tucks into the closet there. That way the children get more room in their rooms.” Vernon explains her only question and she also bounces on the floor a bit to test the feel. She apparently likes the tatami mats and moves on.

“Hmm...” Amara’Gorr notes as she flushes the toilet and sees it all wash away. She then tests the showers and bathtubs. Then sighs. “I’m stalling at this point.”

“You don’t really want to talk to The Dark Forest do you?”

“No. No I do not.” Amara’Gorr says before taking a deep shuddering breath. “It’s one of the most dangerous things alive. Deadly and murderous. Entire armies have been slaughtered beneath its boughs. To say nothing of the sheer damage that Sorcerers have caused in the past.”

“Are you afraid the children will turn out the same?” Vernon asks.

“It’s a valid fear, you must admit.”

“It is, but it’s not one you won’t be able to put to rest without actually speaking to The Dark Forest.” Vernon tells her.

“No... no it’s not.” She admits. “Very well, show me the way sorcerer. Let us have an audience with your dark and terrible master.”

“That sounds like a quote.” Vernon notes even as he gestures for her to follow and leads her downstairs.

“It’s from The Forest Prince series.” Amara’Gorr says almost under her breath.

“Oh, I haven’t read those.”

“I... I’m not sure you’re the type to enjoy them. At least, not unless you like the idea of many men sharing a single woman.”

“I’m pretty sure another man sniffing around my wife would get me in a fairly... let’s call it a Sorcerous mood.” Vernon notes airily.

“Noted.” Amara’Gorr states as he leads her to the outside of the building and they both quickly get their shoes back on. “So how far is it?”

“Just behind the building. It took a bit of work to put this together. However the idea of having a central voice was a little too good to ignore.” Vernon says and Amara’Gorr pauses.

“A central voice!?”

“A place from which a Forest can directly communicate. But I warn you, The Forest is NOT an Apuk, or any other species. It’s... different, very different.”

“Different how?”

“It doesn’t think like us.” Vernon answers. “It can understand us though. It’s also very... very much bigger than us and aware of it.”

“Is it safe?”

“It’s The Dark Forest ma’am, you know the answer to that.” Vernon says and she pauses. He turns around. “It doesn’t have to be safe to be good. It is the poisonous flowers, the deadly predators, the trees, the grasses, the moss and the roots. It is the bark, the leaves and everything that grows, runs, flies, scuttles and burrows within it. Including The Sorcerers. It is me, it is Brin’Char The Bonechewer. It is also three of the children you are evaluating this place for.”

“I see.” She says in a somewhat awed voice. “Do the stories even come close?”

“Strangely enough, people don’t tend to tell Sorcerers what the wild rumours about them are.” Vernon answers. Then she starts to follow again, her heart pounding more and more with every step. Were she human a cold sweat would be pouring down her back.

But she stays resolute, she has a job, an important one that affects the most innocent and deserving of protection. Even as it feels like her heart might leap out of her throat, she still presses forward. Until she stands before an enormous tree just behind the house. There are three strange growths on the side that faces them, two horizontal ones above a larger vertical one that has numerous mosses and vines growing downwards just below it. For a moment, it almost looks like a bearded face.

Then the growths and bumps shift and she realizes that they ARE.

“We... welcome... you...” The Tree states, but it’s voice echoes all around her. From the grass under her feet to the leaves high above, it also echoed from Vernon himself. “We are... We.”

“You are The Dark Forest?” Amara’Gorr asks in a shaking tone.

“We are.” The Forest replies.

“I... oh goddess... I... I am Amara’Gorr. My duty is to determine how... fit... you are as a caretaker of children and... and... please don’t hurt me!”

“You... are safe. We hold... no malice towards you. At worst, we... pity you...”

“Pity?” She asks. That hadn’t been something she expected. Not to say that this day hadn’t been something out of a fever dream already, but this was a step further than the rest.

“You... are alone... that which grows alone will grow stunted... will grow frail... No plant flourishes in barren soil... no beast survives without others... you... are alone... we pity you.” The Dark Forest states.

“Why... why have you offered to take in the Barlis and Harkul children? What does it matter to you?”

“Barlis... Harkul... these woods have placed seedlings in barren ground, watered with hate... they will wither there... they will suffer...” The Dark Forest says and there’s a shaking all around. “Pain and hate... these can be good. They can empower to create safety and growth... this is different. These are poisonous hates, barren pain that does not nurture...”

“Deprived... starved... starved of safety and growth of soul... beneath our boughs they will starve for hunger and hate. Beneath our bough, it is the poisons and barren earth of their old lives they will lack.” The Dark Forest answers.

“And education? What will they learn from you?”

“Much... We are... all that we are... we are Businessmen... we are soldiers, we are students, we are professors and scholars. We are many and strong. The seedlings of Harkul and Barlis will be strong. Stronger than the withered growths they have sprouted from.”

“And what of The Sorcerers? Every traditional sorcerer has emerged from you with violence and wrath in their heart! How do I know you won’t do the same thing to the Barlis and Harkul children?” She demands.

“Wounds... must be closed... suffering must be answered... dangers must be broken... Sorcerers... Sorcerers seek an end to pain... it is remembered... it is remembered until it is broken...” The Dark Forest explains. “Until a fire is quenched... it burns... until vengeance is sated... it burns...”

“That’s not quite the same.”

“It’s close enough.” Vernon says in his own voice, but there are echoes of The Dark Forest. “Think of it like a burrowing termite. Just because it’s not eating you right now, doesn’t mean it won’t start again at any moment. And it can start again at any moment, until you crush it. Then and only then do you finally know peace.”

“A person’s life is very different.” Amara’Gorr states.

“Life... is life... Life grows... life must be nurtured to grow stronger.” The Dark Forest disagrees. “Will nurture Barlis and Harkul seedlings.”

“Will you teach them to seek bloody and terrible vengeance on their foes?” She presses.

“We... will not...” The Dark Forest replies.

“I see... goddess help me, I’m leaning towards approval.” Amara’Gorr mutters with wide eyes.

2024-07-17 23:07:35,"List of ancestry changes in Player Core 2 hello

i wanted to condense all revealed ancestry changes into a single page

all info in this post was grabbed from [this stream by DeadAussieGamer](https://www.youtube.com/live/TIV-fOxRmfo)

overall impressions:
- many of the feats have been streamlined and those that served a similar role have been merged together.
- ancestries that had no lategame options now have at least a few.
- if you want to be a dog, in pathfinder i mean, you can now take Kholo instead of Shoony if you don't want your character to have respiratory issues.
- many changes follow precedents set by Howl of the Wild (power level, early flight, ancestry lore feat & weapon familiarity feat design)


# Universal Changes:

**Ancestry Lore** feats now give you the Additional Lore feat in the apropriate lore, meaning it increases in proficiency automatically.

**Weapon Familiarity** feats now automatically give you critical specialization once you reach lvl 5. Feats that granted you crit spec or gave you expertise with ancestral weapons at lvl 13 didn't get reprinted.

I'm not listing other feats that didn't get reprinted.

# Catfolk

## Base features:

No changes

## Heritages:

- **Nine Lives Catfolk**

Old: 
> If you are reduced to 0 Hit Points by a critical hit on an attack roll, you become dying 1 instead of dying 2.

New:
> While you're dying, you don't add your dying value to the DC of your recovery checks (this means the DC is typically 10). In addition, you gain the Diehard general feat.

## Feats:

- **Cat Nap (lvl 1)** 

Old:
> Once per hour, by sleeping for 10 minutes, you can gain temporary Hit Points equal to your level that last for 10 minutes.

New:
> Hitpoint duration increased to 1 hour.

- **[Merged with Lucky Break] Expanded Luck (lvl 5)**

Old:
> You can trigger Cat's Luck when you fail or critically fail a Fortitude or Will saving throw in addition to Reflex saving throws. You still can use Cat's Luck only once per day.

- **Lucky Break (lvl 5)**

Old:
> You can trigger Cat's Luck when you fail or critically fail on an Athletics or Acrobatics skill check, in addition to its normal trigger. When you do, you reroll the triggering skill check and use the better result. This still counts against Cat's Luck's frequency, as normal.

New:
> You can trigger Cat's Luck when you fail or critically fail a Fortitude saving throw, Will saving throw, Acrobatics check, or Athletics check in addition to Reflex saving throws. You still can use Cat's Luck only once per day.

- **Well-Groomed (lvl 5)**

Used to be lvl 9.

- **[NEW] Luck of the Clowder (lvl 9)**

Replaces Shared Luck

> When you use Cat's Luck to reroll, any creatures you choose within 10 feet who also just failed against the same effect (such as a single spell) can also reroll their saving throws and use the better result.

# Hobgoblin

## Base features:

No changes

## Heritages:

- **Warrenbred Hobgoblin**

Old:
> When you are underground, you can use the Seek action to sense undetected creatures within a 30-foot burst instead of a 15-foot burst. In addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.

New:
> While you're underground, when you target an opponent that is concealed from you or hidden from you, reduce the DC of the flat check to 3 for a concealed target or 9 for a hidden one. In addition, if you roll a success on an Acrobatics check to Squeeze, you get a critical success instead.

## Feats:

- **Alchemical Scholar (lvl 1)**

Old:
> You gain four common 1st-level alchemical formulas when you take this feat, and each time you gain a level, you gain a common alchemical formula of that level. You still need Alchemical Crafting to Craft alchemical items.

New:
> You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat. If you would automatically gain that feat (from your background or the alchemist class, for example), you instead gain a different 1st-level Crafting skill feat. Add an additional common 1st-level alchemical formula to your formula book when you take this feat. Each time you gain a level beyond 1st, add one common alchemical formula of that level to your formula book.

- **Leech-Clip (lvl 1, changed from passive to 2 Actions)**

Old name was Leech-Clipper

Old:
> If you critically hit a foe with a weapon from the flail weapon group, you can wrap the weapon around the target’s legs and then drop it, causing the foe to take a –10-foot circumstance penalty to their Speeds until they or their allies disentangle the weapon, which takes a total of 2 Interact actions.

New:
> Make a melee Strike with weapon from the flail group. On a hit, the target takes a-10-foot status penalty to its Speed (or a-15-foot status penalty on a critical hit). The penalty lasts for 1 round. It applies only if the target has a land Speed and depends on legs or other targetable appendages to use its land Speed. As with all penalties to Speed, this can't reduce a creature's Speed below 5 feet.

- **Cantorian Restoration (lvl 17, Reaction; Once per Day)**

Removed the reference to Breath of Life spell, now has an independent explanation of its effect.

# Kholo

- So, a year ago one of my players didn't come up with a character name for his gnoll during the first session. As a result, I referred to his character as Gee-Noll, and we've been using that name ever since, but now it makes no sense within the Golarion's canon. I am very upset.

## Base features:

Every mention of Gnoll is replaced with Kholo (wow)

## Heritages:

- **[NEW] Cave Kholo**

> Storytellers spin ancient tales claiming that kholo lived in caves and underground before most of your kind ventured into the light. You're a throwback to these ancients, with a broad chest and markings that resemble short black slashes instead of spots. Your eyes are developed to see perfectly in the dark, a valuable advantage to your clan. You gain darkvision.

- **[NEW] Dog Kholo**

puypyy
> You're a nimble-bodied kholo with a prehistoric, almost dog-like build. Though you typically move like a quadruped, you can still stand and fight like a biped, allowing you to use all equipment normally. If you have both hands free, you can increase your Speed to 30 feet as you run on all fours.

## Feats:

If you roll a success on a saving throw against a disease or poison, you get a critical success instead.

- **[NEW] Left-Hand Blood (lvl 5; 1 Action; Once per Hour)**

> It's said that the flesh of the right side of a hyena can heal diseases, but that the flesh of the left side is deadly and poisonous.

On a failure, the enemy takes a -1 status penalty to attack rolls and skill checks for as long as it remains adjacent to you. Regardless of the result of its save, the creature is then temporarily immune to bonekeeper's bane for 24 hours.

- **[NEW] First to Strike, First to Fall (lvl 17)**

> Whenever you successfully Strike a creature that has not acted in the first round of combat, that creature is off-guard untill the end of your next turn. If that creature is reduced to 0 Hit Points before the end of your next turn, you and all allies within 30 feet of the creature become quickened until the end of your next turn. You can use the extra action only to Step, Stride, or Strike.

- **[NEW] Impaling Bone (lvl 17)**

2025-01-04 23:18:38,"{Excerpts}: Estimating the True Scale of the Tyranid Invasion. How many Tyranids lay outside of the Milkyway galaxy is one of 40k's oldest mysteries. For most fans the simple answer of ""as many as the plot demands"" is a rather succinct answer and one that works well enough.  However, I believe we've been given more than enough clues, over 40k's lifespan, to come up with a better answer. Or at least piece together enough to get sense of the actual scale of the invasion.

Going all the way back to January of 1992 we get from what I can gather the first clue to the Tyranid's true scale:

* **White Dwarf #145**

>*""The Tyranid hive mind hungers for fresh genetic material, gene-stocks that can be used to create new bio-construct creatures and organic machine-slaves. Their own galaxy is exhausted, its creatures long since absorbed into the hive mind, their flesh turned to unfathomable purposes or discarded as useless. With its billions of humans and countless other creatures the Imperium offers the Tyranids an almost inexhaustible stock of flesh and genes which will invigorate the hive mind and enable it to embody itself in new forms.*

>*Humanity will be absorbed, broken into strands of DNA to be used to create a new generation of bio-technology. It will be the death of the human race, but to the Tyranid hive mind this is of no more consequence than the mining of ores or the harvesting of crops. For the Tyranids have no sense of pity or compassion, they are as utterly beyond human understanding as humans are beyond their comprehension. To them man is just an inefficient and primitive lifeform, something to be consumed and turned to a higher purpose. Such has been the fate of a thousand galaxies, of millions of intelligent species, since time immemorial.""*

Now for those interested in reading the page for yourself [here's](https://www.reddit.com/r/Tyranids/comments/136xm01/its_january_1992_you_just_pulled_the_latest_white/#lightbox) a reddit post covering it. The most important aspect of this is that, if unless I missing some additional context, this is the omniscient narrator stating this and not some random imperial scholar. Needless to say the Tyranid having exhausted the usable materials of not just 1 galaxy but multiple is quite insane. In the past I've demonstrated that the Tyranids are capable of stripping [sextillions of kg](https://pastebin.com/6wkDeGLn) from just 1 rocky planet. Than consider that just 1 galaxy may have 100 of billions if not trillions of dam things laying around. As Tyranids are known to consume the matter from Gas Giants as well. With that much matter laying around mass producing the [continent size bioships](https://pastebin.com/uaX4ii6e) seen in the past or even the [moon size](https://pastebin.com/UpGCATc8) one wouldn't be unreasonable. This might also explains where Tyranids got all the matter in the first place to replicate some of the things will see later on. However, it should be noted that this is old lore. So it comes with the caveat that it might've been retconned. That being said I don't think the over trend/direction GW has gone with the Tyranids shows that to be the case.

Our next clue comes from the book Eye of Terror, by Barrington J. Bayley, released on November of 1992:

* **Eye of Terror:**

>*""A long, awkward silence followed these words, until Drang spoke again, in a different, graver tone that shocked them all.*

>*’In any case, the tyranids might settle it all in the end.’*

>*’And what do you mean by that, brother commander? The tyranids are awesome, but we have dealt with them before.’*

>*’Yes, we defeated Hive Fleet Behemoth,’ Drang granted soberly. ’But with difficulty. And then came Hive Fleet Kraken. Have you considered this, commander? Each tyranid hive fleet consists of millions of vessels. What if Behemoth and Kraken were but the first members of a swarm of such fleets, itself numbering millions, which even now is advancing on our galaxy? Nature’s profligacy reaches its most monstrous proportions in the tyranid. Nothing the Imperium can do could stop such a horde. It would leave behind it a dead galaxy, every trace of life extinguished. Even the Chaos realm would be gone. The tyranid hive mind has no soul, no spiritual counterpart. When a tyranid fleet moves through the warp, it is like a wall erasing everything in its path. A tyranid super-fleet such as I have described would be enough to extinguish the accursed Chaos gods and all their subjects.’ ’You paint a grim picture, my lord,’ Invisticone murmured. He recalled that the Ultramarines Chapter of the Adeptus Astartes had captured a Behemoth tyranid ship intact, and study of it had revealed much. It was clear that the tyranid were not of this galaxy. They came from afar, and for all anyone knew had been migrating through space forever. Leaving a great trail of lifeless galaxies behind them, perhaps?*

>*And who was to say that there was only one super-fleet such as Drang had so graphically imagined? Conceivably there was a stupendous number of those in turn. The tyranid might be the universe’s ultimate life-form, depending on infinity itself to sustain its eternal existence. As each dead galaxy was left behind it would, in a few billion years, recover, evolve life all over again, ready to be harvested by some other tyranid super-fleet.*

>*The tyranid themselves might be infinite in number for all anyone knew. In the face of such a vision the whole of mankind, even the Emperor Himself, seemed helpless and insignificant - a treasonous thought indeed!""*

Now this is admittedly once again very old lore, but the same logic as before applies. In fact take that to be the case with any old lore. This one also isn't a statement from the omniscient narrator. Just characters ruminating about the true scale of Tyranid invasion they face. However, it's important since it's the start of a noticeable trend. Where characters that are well informed about the Tyranids seem convinced that their isn't just more off them on the way, but an insurmountable amount. For example in this one the characters seem to think that they're may be millions of hivefleets that make of the greater swarm and this number will only grow in time.

Moving on than we have Dark Imperium an anthology of 40k horror shorts stories release in 2001. The short story that interest us is the one written by non other than Barrington J. Bayley, known as Hivefleet Horror. Seems the man had a vision for the Tyranids and this short story further expanded on that vision. A bit of context for the quote further ahead. A nascent psyker is taken with other captives of Hive Fleet Kraken and in the midst of their ""experiments"" he connects with a Hive-Tyrant near him:

* **Hivefleet Horror:**

>*""And then he became aware of the psychic presence of the tyranids. It was weird, like nothing else he had ever experienced: an implacable, ferocious sentience which was ancient beyond imagining. It stood alone; no one would ever be able to speak to it.*

>*Suddenly he felt as though his psyche had been torn apart like the human body on the floor of the chamber. The scene before his eyes vanished.*

>*He was somewhere else. Somewhere dark, but filled with a seething and a rustling. He had entered the hive mind.*

>*And now he understood what the tyranids were.*

>*The Tyranids were what ants and termites would be if they could evolve further and become intelligent. What made such intelligence incomprehensible was that the tyranids had never evolved emotions. They were aware that concepts such as sympathy and honour existed in the species they harvested, but they viewed them only in the abstract and dismissed them as evolutionary mistakes. Gene coding for emotion was never made use of by the hive fleets.*

>*Yes, the tyranids were intelligent, but intelligence was not a quality particularly prized by the hive mind. A tyranid creature could reason, but it never did so out of self-interest. Intelligence, like everything else, served only tyranid hive instincts - or rather, it served the single great tyranid instinct the one overwhelming, compulsive urge.*

>*SURVIVE! AND SURVIVE FOREVER!*

>*When the tyranids invaded a galaxy they took aboard vast amounts of foodstuffs and raw materials, but those were not what they came looking for. They knew that every system, whether mechanical or biological, eventually runs down. Most species lasted only a few million years. A few - like some Earth ants - managed to survive for up to a hundred million years. But sooner or later they perished as their DNA either failed to adapt or simply deteriorated through natural wear.*

>*The tyranids had found the only possible remedy for this. They moved from galaxy to galaxy, harvesting fresh, newly evolved DNA with which to renew and reinvigorate their own. They were the universe's ultimate life form. Quite possibly they had exisited forever and would continue to exist forever. Quite possibly the universe contained an infinite number of hive fleets.*

>*The Imperium of Man had beaten off one hive fleet. Perhaps it could beat off others. It would be a rare reversal for the tyranids, but that did not matter at all. In a few million years the Imperium would be gone, the human race would be gone, and some other hive fleet would arrive, meeting weaker resistance, and would leave the galaxy lifeless and desolate.*

>*Then, a few billion years later, life would evolve all over again, on millions of planets.*

>*And again a hive fleet would move in....*

>*Jaxabarm did not think the hive tyrant was at all aware that he was eavesdropping on the hive mind. He was not worthy of notice. They tyranid did not respect human intelligence - tyranid did not respect any intelligence, not even their own. All they saw in the human race was a species possessing young, vigorous DNA.*

>*...*

>*He would try to persuade Drenthan Drews to join the Imperial Guard and help defend the Imperium. Hive Fleet Kraken had to be repelled or humanity was doomed.*

>*Not that the outcome was of any importance to the tyranids. To them, species evolved and perished like blades of grass. Galaxies condensed, blazed, then guttered out. The supposedly immortal Chaos gods would not even last that long. They would perish when the psyches which sustained them died out.*

>*Only the tyranids lasted forever.""*

Now this one is more concrete than the other since it's one of the rare instances which we get the thoughts of the Hivemind directly. And truths reveled in this one are pretty startling. For starters the Hivemind already has a process for invading galaxy, further evidence that it has consumed multiple. It also believes its self capable of invading the Milkyway for millions years, even at its current rate of attrition. Finally Jaxabarm concludes that there's once again an insurmountable number of hivefleets in the intergalactic void.

This next quote can be trace back to the 5th Ed Core Rulebook which released in 2008, but can also be found in the Tyranid Codex of the same edition:

**• 5th Ed Core Rulebook:**

>*""The Tyranids are the most alien of races to infest Imperial space, for they come from the void itself. Their chitinous bio-ships drift from star system to star system in brooding silence. Behind the Hive Fleets lie the barren husk of a dozen galaxies already consumed. Once the remorselessly hungry shoals of bio-ships detect the presence of a prey world, they begin to teem with life, closing upon their target like a set of impossibly large jaws. There can be no escape from their fatal embrace. For this reason the Tyranids are known as the Great Devourer.""*

This statement is once again written from the perspective of an omniscient narrator and further back up the claim that the Tyranids have consumed entire galaxies. So, everything said about the WD #145 quote applies here as well.

Now for our next quote I'm not sure when it was released, but I've track it down to coming from Liber Administratum book. Or at least that's where I think it comes from. If anybody else has better answer let me know:

**• Liber Administratum:**

> *""Munitorum Strategic Intelligence Collective*

> 

>*The Munitorum Strategic Intelligence Collective is a secret arm of the Administratum that is composed of senior Ordo Xenos Inquisitors and Magos Biologis Genetors and Xenobiologists of the Adeptus Mechanicus. It is their primary mission to compile biological and logistical data on the Tyranids to determine their weaknesses and devise suitable counter-measures to future Hive Fleet invasions. These secretive reports are sent directly to the High Lords of Terra themselves. Their analysis of all the details of the Tyranid invasions thus far has seen them draw a startling conclusion as stark as it is terrifying: the Hive Fleets faced by the Imperium to date are but parts of a far greater whole, and this whole will be arriving at the Imperium's borders within less than a standard century. They estimate that Imperial mobilization levels will need to be increased by a minimum of 500% -- which would effectively include every able-bodied man, woman and child on every world in Segmentums Solar, Obscurus and Tempestus -- to have even a hope of stopping this dire threat.""*

This one once again reinforces that trend of informed characters/organizations thinking there's an insurmountable amount of Tyranids out their in the void. With the Imperium literally having to increase mobilization by a realistically impossible to reach amount to even stand a chance.

Our next quote comes from the short story Wratihflight, released in 2014, in which an Eldar Farseer makes contact with the Tyranid Hivemind and sees it in all its glory:

* **Shield of Baal \[Wraithflight\]** :

>*""Something was wrong. A sensation at the back of her mind. The sensation grew teeth, became pain. Her soul was gripped by agony.*

>*Iyanna screamed, falling from the edge of the couch. The pain abated, then squeezed her anew. She vomited. The dead were dismayed. The blow against her raced out across her attack group, leaping from mind to mind. Wraithbomber engines guttered out. The Wraithborne´s sleek cruisers turned viciously, wallowing in psychic swell. Bright light burned at Iyanna´s soul. A long tunnel telescoped away, encompassing infinite distance. A tube stabbed through the fabric of the world. She felt its ripples in the warp. She felt its ripples in the webway.*

>*She had the sense of an eye, slave to a great power. An intellect that dwarfed the Great Wheel of the galaxy. She opened her second sense, to find the Dragon looking at her with terrible regard. For aeons it seemed to held her in its gaze. And there was fury in that examination.""*

In here the text just blatantly states that the Hivemind dwarf the Milkyway. With the Hivemind itself just being the collection of psychic links found across the Tyranids. Meaning the connection potentially encompass an area of space greater than the wheel of the galaxy. [Hmm wonder if that'll ever get Illustrated...](https://youtu.be/6aHsekhCfLM?si=iMyp1PrZ8MXwmKN2)

Our next quote is luckly rather blatant and from a recent edition of the game:

**• 9th Ed Codex \[Tyranids\]:**

>*""A billion times a billion tyranid stands at the rim of the galaxy, yet each one is no more than a single cell in the living body of the Hivemind, ""THE DEVOURER OF WORLDS"".""*

A billion times a billion would give you 1 quintillion bioships, and yes I say bioships. As during these intergalactic voyages outside of a few defensive/maintenance bioform. The standard bioform we've come to expect would be absent. As those are render down to biomatter sludge prior to hibernation. Considering [the average hivefleet has millions of bioships](https://pastebin.com/edCgDD8H) this would mean out their in the void there's potentially trillions of hivefleets. Which would certainty add up with everything we've discuss thus far. And it only gets crazier.

Finally this leads us to the last clue I've been able to have and it perhaps give us the grimace picture.  As an Inquisitor that's dedicated his whole life to study the Tyranids runs down his grim findings:

* **10th Ed Codex \[Tyranid\]:**

>*""The brutal truth was that he had made precious little difference. Perhaps no more than a score of systems endured a Tyranid invasion thanks to his intervention, and some of them had been consumed by Hive Fleet Hydra or Kronos in follow-up attacks regardless.*

>*Every night, Uziyr was haunted by the terrible conclusions the Collective had reached. He would not have been surprised if now these estimates were already too hopeful.*

>*“...number of instances in which Tyranid bio- forms have... survived the Exterminatus...""*

>*“...the hive fleets we have thus far encountered represent but the vanguard of a far larger force…”*

>*“...there may in fact be more hive fleets than there are worlds…”*

>*“...current mobilisation levels will need to be increased a minimum of 500% if we are even to stand a chance of slowing the advance of the Hive Mind... every able-bodied man and woman on every world in the Ultima Segmentum, Segmentum Pacificus and Segmentum Solar will need to be drafted into the Imperial Guard…”*

>*And that was before the Rift, before Pankallis, before Bastior, Uziyr thought.*

>*He eyed his laspistol Polantair. It promised him oblivion. It promised him escape.*

>*All it would take was one pull of the trigger.""*

Once again there might be 100 of billions if not a trillion planets in the galaxy. If we take are inquisitor most dire concerns literally than the number of hivefleets may be as high as that. Which shockinly add up pretty well with the number we estimated prior.

So yeah a trillion or so hivefleets out there in the void seems to be my best guess, given what information we have. Needless to say if the 9 or so hivefleets that have arrive in the galaxy represent an existential threat. Than the galaxy is truly doomed to a bloody mess. Since if unless the denizens of the galaxy can find away to deal with the Hivemind directly.  There's absolutely no hope of defeating an enemy that has more ships than you have people.",Negative_Sock4219,Reddit,Neutral,0.03288710391847275
2025-01-24 03:26:24,"A little pep talk for troubling times as we step in front of frightened students and colleagues... America voted for fascism in the 2024 election. Any attempt to explain away that simple interpretation is denying the basic facts that Donald Trump won both the electoral college and the popular vote by promising extreme nationalism, xenophobia, and revenge against ""internal enemies."" It's [textbook fascism plain and simple.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fascism?wprov=sfla1)

That doesn't mean that we'll get fascism, nor is it unusual that fascism won an election... It has everywhere it did take hold in the past and present. 

However, there is reason to hope as well as those very justified reasons to fear. 

Many folks (one post here in r/Professors put it especially clearly) have been saying:

> the American people voted for this.

And while it IS true that the largest plurality of American VOTERS voted for this, it is NOT true that the majority of American people WANTED this. 

*Spoiler for what follows: about 20% of people in America affirmatively wanted this. 19.9% affirmatively did not want it. About 20% could have voiced their opinion (voted) but didn't. And 40% of people didn't get to voice their opinion but, based on how the American system works and how (un)representative eligible voters are compared to people who aren't eligible to vote, would disproportionately have said No if they'd been allowed to vote. 

This is one of those (rare) times when quant analysis can be pro social and life affirming rather than soul sucking and dickish. (full disclosure, I'm a multi-method scholar.... Quals find me to be too quantish and quants think I'm a militant qual; I teach a quant methods course for people who aren't assholes about it).

Donald Trump won the presidency and the popular vote in 2024. That's 100% true.

But.

BUT!

He won only a plurality of the votes among people who voted.

He did NOT win a majority of people who voted (Kamala + third parties were >50% of cast votes). He won [49.8 percent](https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election,_2024) 

And voter turnout was [63.7 percent](https://ballotpedia.org/Election_results,_2024:_Analysis_of_voter_turnout_in_the_2024_general_election )

So by winning, 49.8% of people who voted, and that's only 63.7% of people who could vote, he really only had the support of 31.7% eligible voters.

But there are only 161.4 million eligible voters in the USA out of a total adult population of 262 million and a total population of 334 million.

But adults aren't the only ones who matter AND eligible voters are NOT a representative cross section of even adults, much less of all Americans (even of all American citizens, although non citizens are also Americans ffs).

So at worst, 31.7% of Americans wanted him to be president, but we know that's an OVER estimate. It definitely not 106 million people (31.7% of total population) and it's probably not even 83.4 million (31.7% of adult population). It's maybeeee 51. 2 million people (31.7% of eligible voters) but that's assuming that people who voted are representative of people who could have voted but didn't, which is a very very poor assumption based on the evidence we have from the past and well supported social theory. 

So that means that between 110 million and 282 million Americans DIDN'T want this and DIDN'T vote for this. That's up to 82% of people in America who didn't want this. 

That means that maybe 1 in 4 or 1 in 5 Americans wanted this. And statistically, our students were not that 1 in 4 or 5.

Sure maybe 1 in 5 didn't care enough to actively work against this by voting even though they could. But even if acquiescence is complicity it's not support (and there are many reasons for acquiescence to NOT be complicity). 

And that leaves 2/5 of americans who didn't get to have a say but disproportionately can be estimated NOT to have wanted this (because they're immigrants, or have their voting rights taken away, or are too young to vote, all groups who disproportionately didnt want this based on evidence we have from both polls and subsets of voters who can be representative of those populations) 

Yes, major structural reform is needed for America to take a step from being a deeply flawed democracy to a more representative one. But that's happened before. In the 1960s, America somewhat surprisingly took a giant leap from a fake democracy (Jim crow apartheid) to a flawed one (civil rights and voting rights acts made Jim crow illegal, but southern strategies, jerrymandering, the electoral college, and partisan+geogrqphic sorting by ideology have kept the US presidency and legislature poorly representative of most Americans (as compared to most frequent voters)).

Change is possible.

But we can't do it alone.

What we can do, as teachers, is teach. It's what we're best at and it's demonstrably turning out better humans now than it ever has in world history.

Yes, that's why there is a backlash.

But the shrinking minority of powerful, loud, and cruel backlash hate us because they feel the threat.

We teach because it's what we can do. They hate us because they know we are convincing and most people who choose to learn chose love not hate.

It's not necc all we can do but it's what we can do better than anyone else. 

And it works. 

And that's fucking awesome.

Tldr:math shows us that worst case 25% of people in America wanted this. 20% affirmatively said NO. 20% chose not to say no (but had the option to) and 35% didn't have the option to say yes or no (but we can robustly say based on evidence would have disproportionately said no if they could have).

Appendix: note that this pep talk isn't necessarily just for liberal or progressive professors. The impact of teaching isn't just a liberal or progressive value. It's an American value. It's why we have free public schools and why, in the beginning, they were the envy of the world. If you're a conservative professor, you and I may see very differently on a lot of issues. But we should agree that anti-fact fascism is counter to the one thing we both would hold sacrosanct: the pursuit of knowledge and it's ability to enrich lives.

2021-08-06 17:16:40,"I used to work as a social media moderator. These are the things you don’t hear about. (Part 2) Well, here we are again. 

I can’t say I was expecting the response [to my last post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/oxqu6z/i_used_to_work_as_a_social_media_moderator_these/) A lot of you work in similar fields and were very open about your experiences. Honestly, it felt like a damn share circle, but a good one. I appreciate it. 

Some were doubters and that’s okay, too. I don’t think I’d enjoy knowing that there’s entire office blocks with thousands of employees dedicated to filtering out the unmitigated torrent of shit that gets thrown through our screens 24/7. 

Let's not waste any more time. 

**""Drive.""**

I wanna start off by telling you about another employee in our sister building; Yardley Heights and what Nicholas did leading up to his dismissal. Some of you mentioned surprise that Jeff caught prison time for his assault of the dirty little neck beard sharing hate and underage nudes. I agree, he shouldn’t have, but when you permanently blind a guy and shatter his teeth with a beating, you’re not going to get let off with a warning.

However, I feel like after what Nicholas was caught doing, it’s good that we have harsher rules for people in charge of data who abuse it. 

Someone has to watch the watchmen. 

Nicholas was… an incel. There’s no pleasant way to say it. He wasn’t bad looking, really. Tall, gangly and very intelligent, Nicholas’s problems stemmed from not understanding social norms.

For example, sharing with your co-workers that you REALLY like feet when they’re wearing sandals or that a woman who turns you down because she has a boyfriend is a “Stacy” and a “thot”. He would routinely make hurtful memes and put them in the break room, his little friend group back home calling him “based” and egging him on to try bolder tactics “like a true alpha”.

All of this is pretty cringe, I know. Nobody likes talking about these guys, let alone reading about it, but given what happened, it warrants discussion. 

After all, I’m here to tell you about what you DON’T see, right? 

Nicholas is fielding reports and stumbles across a girl’s leaked nudes. He’s immediately besotted. He doesn’t care that she might be underage, that these are private photos. He downloads them without any care and it only takes our IT guys a half hour or less to notify our boss. He’s caught and reprimanded with suspension pending investigation, but he already knows he’s going to be fired and potentially prosecuted. 

Yet, they failed to overlook one important fact:

Nicholas had the rest of her private information when he got the flag.

And he saved it. 

A month later, Nicholas was spotted driving across state lines in his dad’s car. His last known movements show him turning into an alleyway and not emerging from the other side. 

His account was being monitored and posts that would fit his behaviours were kept a close eye on. 

Sure enough, three posts of note would pop up. Two from his personal account and one from an anonymous board fielding information only he would have.

The two personal posts were a photo of him holding a girl and positively beaming, kissing her on the forehead. There were tears in her eyes. 

The caption: “Finally met my goddess! Tonight is going to be amazing, then we’re going to have a grand finale!”

His few friends and family responding BEGGED him to get in touch with them, that he needed to speak to the authorities. But Nicholas ignored them, as he did with every phonecall from his parents and psychologist. 

Then, 2 hours later, a post was made to an anonymous board with several photos that when sent to us, made my blood run cold and Nicholas’ manager quit before taking her life some months later with a written apology to the girl's family.

*“Hey bros,* 

*I did it! I got the girl of my dreams, she’s a real cute e-girl and I can’t believe I was so lucky!*

*It must have been fate that her photos came up on my computer. I believe god wanted me to have her. Like in the olden days, take the woman you want and make her your wife, even if that’s by force. You can’t stop destiny, right?*

*I never would’ve gotten this far without you guys. Without this place. You all showed me how to be a REAL man, to step out of my own beta male shadow and take what it rightfully mine.*

*We had a magical night, but she’s growing cold towards me.*  

*It’s time to speed things up.* 

*I’ll see you in the afterlife bros. I hope you get your girls too!*

*I’ll be welcomed with open arms.* 

*F,*

*Nicholas.”*

He’d only posted one photo to go with the post. 

A photo of the dashboard of his car, speeding down a road and towards a cliff-edge. 

When they eventually found the wreckage, both of them were found inside, charred to bits. 

Nicholas still had his arms wrapped around the poor girl. 

Even in death.

**New Face/Old Face.**

I have a couple of weird ones I want to share with you. After our last helping of animal and child abuse, I wanted to switch things up and share some of the more odd occurrences. Don’t worry, it’s still stomach churningly gross and grim… I just don’t like delving into detail on THOSE subjects, you know how it is. Nobody has fun reading about them. 

It was the fall of 2017. It’d been a solid 3 months since I’d had a major incident, just the usual dick pics, racist commentary and occasional violent video or execution. I realise that sounds horrific, and it is, but I wouldn’t be here if every little thing affected me.

Contrary to what some people think; we are made of sterner stuff here. We wouldn’t make it otherwise.

An account began getting flooded for spam reports and multiple users were reporting that they couldn’t even use the site because they were getting post notifications and comments from the same account:

*“NewFace OldFace.”*

It was astronomical how much they were interacting with these people. Thousands of comments simply saying “I LIKE YOUR FACE” over and over… A bot script running at peak efficiency was my guess. 

Checking their profile, I immediately felt unsettled. 

Their profile picture was them with a paper mache mask, the eyes drawn in a Picasso style and the skin crinkled in the corners, cracked in other places. Their bio just had that… unsettling vibe you get when you see a boomers profile. 

*“NEWFACE. OLDFACE. ART. DANCING. WINDOWS. ALWAYS SEARCHING FOR MORE.”*

Sure, without the visual aid, that just seems like some child’s attempt at being spooky. But having those uneven eyes staring at you while you scan their profile was a different kind of creepy. 

I scrolled down and noticed they had a normal amount of friends, none of which had profile pictures, a series of posts just stating more of the same from their bio… and a single video.

The video was something straight out of a nightmare fuel gallery. It was late in the office and my only other two colleagues were across the hall. I felt the hairs on my neck stand up as I hit play.

The camera was positioned in a long hallway, the only light coming from behind, an eerie blue hue just barely illuminating the surroundings and ensuring the remainder of the front was enshrouded in darkness. 

*""NewFace.”* Something called out, echoing along the walls. High pitched and scratchy, almost animalistic. 

*“OldFace.”* Lower, more gravelly, getting closer.

It chanted the name in this strange fashion as something stirred in the darkness, taking tentative steps with each iteration of the calling.

They were wearing an all-black morph suit, walking backwards on their hands and knees. They must have been a contortionist because their joints should’ve snapped under the pressure. On their torso lay something white and pink. Their head was tucked in until they were in perfect line of sight with the camera. 

*“NewFace.”* They pushed their chest up and I swear I heard a cracking sound, the small shape that sat there flying into the air and being caught by their left hand. 

*“OldFace.”* Their head snapped up and those unsettling, Picasso drawn eyes met the camera lens. 

They held up the item to the screen, and I felt that sense of being sized up by something far more powerful than I am. The bile rose in my throat as it came into view. 

A perfectly reconstructed face, lips somehow looking plump, a bit of colour in the cheeks, a scar across the chin, a mole over the eyebrow and flopping around in his hand. 

It looked **too real.** 

And then he began pulling up the bottom of his mask. A bright red chin and broken teeth came into view for just a second as the video ended with two more words that chilled me:

*“My... Face.”* 

I immediately banned the account for spam and sent responses to the people who’d complained.

All of them responded with a thankyou save one, their profile photo had been taken off and all info on them had been removed, as if the account was deactivated. 

I made a note of it and signed off for the night, happy I’d put in a good night’s work. 

When I got in for my next shift a couple days later, I was pulled into a side room by my ops manager and someone I didn’t recognise. They wore black shades and said very little to begin with.

*“Hey, Ted, you remember the situation the other night? With the mass spam reports?”* 

*“Yeah, what about it?”*

*“What do you recall about the profile you shut down?”* 

I paused, casting my mind back to that unsettling page. 

*“Mm, they had a weird profile, like an art project. Only maybe 20 friends, all of them with no pictures.”* 

*“Did you check their accounts?”* The other one chimed in. His voice was low, authoritative, serious. I felt uneasy. 

*“No, why would I?”* 

They exchanged a look and put a piece of paper in front of me.

A missing persons report with the name of the final account I couldn’t get in touch with. A young man. 

But it wasn’t the report that scared me so much.

It was his face.

The smile, the light of his eyes…

And the scar on his chin. 

It took me some time to calm down, and I was assured I’d not done anything wrong. I’d just stumbled over something that was out of my depth. The other guy took over, someone from the FBI looking into the missing persons and, if they were connected, my company naturally working closely with them. There wasn’t much I could offer them, sadly, just told them what I knew and promised I’d be on the lookout, hoping I’d never see such a sight again. 

But when it comes to the most awful things this place has, they don’t stay hidden for too long. 

And it would ultimately contribute to why I left the profession. Or was forced out. Depends how you look at it. 

Maybe I’ll tell you all about it soon. 

-----

One more for the road. Maybe I’ll come back again to share some more. There's still a few left in the tank and if people care, i'll keep sharing. But it’s not about the destination so much as the journey, right? 

Let’s talk about **“The SafeKeepers.”**

We talked before about someone who clearly liked faces far too much, fetishizing it and twisting it into something truly horrific. 

But what about when a normal regular face, the kind you see every time you go on the internet or social media, is what chills you most?

A couple of statistics for you before we begin; Someone goes missing every 90 seconds. In the time it’s taken you to get this far, half a dozen people or more have vanished into thin air.

They are more likely to be under 21 years old and twice as likely to be female. Half of them are intentional runaways, a quarter are eventually found safe and well, the last quarter never turn up.

Of the 350,000 that will go missing in a standard year, 5,500 never turn up. If they’re not found within the first week, they’re likely to never turn up again. 

Now ask yourself; why do we find so few? 

I say all of this because there’s vast metrics of data available at our fingertips and they utilise as much up-to-date info as possible to assist us and vice versa in our mission to help raise flags for authorities when someones account is flagged because they’re missing either by a mutual friend (this is common if the person is suicidal and expresses as such) or if they suspect harm could come to them. 

But there are places that operate under the radar with far more up-to-date information.

Enter: We Must Find Them. A professional page set up in 2012 that routinely shares Amber Alerts, uplifting posts and generally helpful information about missing persons and resources that you can use to share awareness. All good stuff.

Of course, that’s not it. 

First report about the page came in with a message from the user:

*“Search up SafeKeepers”* 

I asked my colleague Wanda to find what she could while I checked over the initial report. They claimed the page was sending out coded messages, embedded within the code of their videos, photos and occasionally cypher coded in their amber alerts. It’d attracted so much interest that there was even a group dedicated to solving it that seemed… odd. 

Sure enough, Wanda found a closed group called “The Safekeepers” and of the 200 or so there, a handful of studious members dominated the posts. 

A lot of wild theories were being thrown around, very similar to the Wayfair scandal we saw recently, mostly baseless claims from two particular “keepers”, Stu Bryant and Dom Machado, both of which described themselves as avid code-breakers and proud conspiracy theorists on their respective profiles. Ordinary guys, just a bit too much time on their hands. 

Scrolling back through their posts, you’d see them flagging small, innocuous details and claiming it pointed to “obvious death cults taking these poor innocent people!” or “anyone else noticed they just VANISH? You know how you vanish? Hollow. Earth.” It wasn’t exactly the scientific method, and I found myself actually chuckling at a couple of them. It was harmless fun.

After a year and a half, however, they’d amassed a small group of other dedicated scholars and they’d become extremely focused on hard facts. I don’t know if it was the thrill of the chase making them work at their craft or just an audience, but they began finding legitimate messages hidden in some of the advertisement videos the page put up when providing information on a missing person or layered in a photo.

Things took a turn about 3 months prior to when they’d notified me. Dominick shared an email sent to his work email that he did not give out. He captioned it simply: 

*“Guys… they know.”* 

***From:*** *hello@wemustfindthem.org*  
***To:*** *DMachado*   
***Subject:*** *Esmerelda. 19.11.17* 

It started on a black screen, a low static-y drone playing in the background as white text flickered.

*“Esmerelda Machado, 13 years old. Loves her Papi, best friends Sarah and Mara, still scared of shadows.”*

The image shifted, and I felt sick. 

A photo of who I assumed to be Esmerelda smiling in her school picture, steadily being distorted and twisted as the next set of text appeared:

*“She went missing on her walk home from school. It took her alcoholic mother and absentee father a full DAY to realise she was gone. They thought she was at a friend’s house.”* 

The image shifted once more and my hands started shaking as I took in what I was seeing.

A photo of Esmerelda walking home, the sun setting early with it being the winter. The photo was grainy, the car it was taken from moving steadily and getting agonisingly close to her, without her even knowing.

*“She’s with us now. Keep. Safe.”*

A photo of an open solitary window flashes for a few seconds as a high-pitched alarm flares for a moment, mocking the group before switching to a blackened screen with those eponymous words from their page that took on a far more sinister meaning in light of the content:

**“We must find them.”**

Dominick’s daughter had indeed gone missing. He was separated from her mother and had visitations on weekends. Her mother was so drunk she’d simply assumed she’d been at her friend’s. By the time Dominick raised the alarm, valuable time had passed, and the search was hampered by investigation issues. 

Whoever was last involved, they’d passed on the info to the police and the page had been investigated, but it couldn’t be proved it came from the page and the website was defunct. They never found Esmerelda and Dominick completely gave up on posting to the group, leaving it to Stu and a dedicated group. Stu picked up the slack in his colleagues’ absence, reminding people constantly of Esmerelda’s disappearance and sharing posts the page would make to bring up more inconsistencies and accusing them of all sorts of things. Sometimes baseless and out of anger, other times clear work put into their process.

The penultimate post from Stu said he *“had something groundbreaking thanks to a tip from a reliable source”* and would be exposing the page for who they are and WHAT they were doing. 

So you’re asking where the report comes in, right?

Well, another video got posted by Stu, another personalised warning. 

Stu didn’t have children, but he did have a brother he adored. 

And the page found out about it.

Black screen, red text, a sombre and pitch shifted song crooning in the background.

*“CJ Bryant, 18 years old. Just got his girlfriend pregnant, hadn’t told his best friend and big bro Stu yet. Was excited to see him as an uncle.”* 

This time, the photo they displayed of CJ showed him sleeping in his bed, a tall shadow looming over him.

*“He has no idea.”* 

Another distorted window flashes up with the same taunting message.

*“He’s with us now. Keep. Safe.”*

The video goes to black. 

CJ was taken from his home without a struggle and without witnesses in the dead of night while Stu was working the night shift. He was an athletic young man and was somehow subdued and captured without ANY resistance. That terrifies me. 

But instead of the video going to their organisation's name, it added something extra. 

Something that would cause me to leap out of my seat and have a panic attack. Something we would raise a red alert over and set off alarm bells up the chain of command. I wouldn't go back to my home until I was assured a patrol car and a gun.

*“We’ve recently encountered resistance. Unwanted eyes are upon us. As such, we are entering into a partnership to keep them hidden. Keep them safe.”*

A series of photos of my entire team, including me, flashed up on screen as a slowed down, pitch shifted version of The Polices “Every Breath You Take” played. Those infamous words burned into my brain even now, putting me on high alert more than anything else would ever do in this fucking job.

Because when we gaze into the abyss and someone stares back it is the most terrifying experience and no amount of page deletions and removals would blind the many eyes now watching us intently:

**“We must find them.”** 

Their partner? Oh, you already know of them. I felt the bile rise up in my throat at the mere name flashing on screen.

Red text. Flashing. 

To the backdrop of an open window.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Zaanta watched in horror as her friend flew through the air and hit the ground a couple of meters away. She sent a quick healing spell in Ghanna’s direction before focusing on the creature in front of her.

It was a biped, a very tall one clad head-to-toe in black mana armor full of small dents, cracks and symbols. She couldn’t see its eyes due to the narrow slit in its helmet, but she knew it was watching their group. She expected the creature to attack, move towards them, or at least roar, but it was just standing there. Menacingly!

Next to her, Tina briefly panicked,but quickly recovered, and prepared herself for action.  ""What should we do, Zaanta? Fall back and prepare for an attack? Or secure Ghanna?"" Tina whispered, ready to erect a barrier at any time. 

But Zaanta just shook her head and lowered her staff. ""It is not attacking us for  now. Let's try and find out its intentions first before blindly attacking."" She then gestured to everyone to calm down and spoke to the scholars. ""Lower your weapons, wands and staves. I don't want to see a single being with an active weapon."" 

""You cannot be serious!"" one of the scholars yelled out. ""We've just seen that thing knock out your warrior companion and you tell us to basically expose ourselves to that?! You must have lost your mind!"" 

""There are three things you are neglecting, sir scholar."" Zaanta snapped back. ""First one being that if it wanted to attack us it would have already done so without giving us any time to retaliate. It would have valid reason to do so, because we attacked first. "" She pointed at the being in question and continued. ""The second one being that it has a very good weapon in reach, which it could use very easily. Mallets aren't as hard to use as swords, you see?"" 

Multiple eyes followed the trajectory Guild master pointed in and sure enough, saw the mallet Ghanna dropped right next to it. ""Third thing you might have not paid attention in whatever briefing your sects gave you, if any at all,: that thing might be highly intelligent, perhaps even sapient based on its behavior up until now. 

With a lot of reluctance visible in her movements, Tina lowered her staff, her vision focused on the thing In front of them. After a while the scholars followed suit and discharged their staffs and in two cases resheated their blades. They didn't secure them, but this was enough. She hoped. 

Tina leaned close to her and whispered the question that bothered Zaanta from the first time she saw the thing. ""What do you think it is? And how did it get here?"" 

Zaanta thought for a while more, before answering so everyone could hear her. ""There are two possibilities of what that is. Either an experimental slave that's running amok after killing its masters, or whatever The Fallen Leaves found and Familiarized I don't see any other option that is viable in this case."" She could feel the disgust the group felt towards slavery, especially abused ones like this, but she had to make sure everyone understood the situation they found themselves in. 

""Let's move towards Ghanna, I don't want her to do something…Ghanna-like."" Thus motivated, the group began to advance in Ghanna’s direction. The being in black was still focused on them, but it didn't move aside from turning its head towards them. 

As the group approached Ghanna, they could see the reason she was unable to get up on her own. The thing she got swatted with was… an armored Curmin paladin corpse. Only her head and upper torso were visible, her hands trapped underneath the Curmin. 

""Zaanta!"" Ghanna yelled, her voice filled with rage. ""You're here! Help me get this thing off of me! It's too heavy for me."" 

Zaanta wondered if it would be better for the group to stop Ghanna from moving and causing more harm, but in the end she chose to get her out. It would be bothersome and dangerous if the thing decided to attack and Ghanna couldn’t help. ""I'm on it. Just don't do anything stupid as soon as you get out."" Zaanta turned to the group watching her, trying to figure out how to extricate Ghanna, before calling out to them. ""Guus, Tina, and the scholars are to watch that thing. If it moves in a concerning way, call out to us and try to slow it down if you can’t stop it. The rest of us will get that armored corpse off Ghanna."" 

Aside from bewildered expressions from the scholars, everyone quickly went to work. Guild security, together with Zaanta and the two Raaketigs, began to push the dead paladin off of Ghanna, while the rest stood guard.

""Stupid Curmin paladins! Do they really have to use this spell on each of their armors?!"" one of the guards cursed under his breath. The Curmin had a habit of equipping their armors with a Decrease Weight spell. Thanks to that, their armor could be considerably heavier and offer the same amount of protection as other races’ armor, while using common and easy-to-obtain resources to create them, unlike, for example, Zhaarin paladin armor, which used rare and expensive materials to be both light and strong. This allowed the Curmin to increase the weight of the armor to stop attacks with high momentum at the cost of consuming the wearer’s Mana. 

""Report! The thing has not moved aside from a couple of steps to regain its balance, but the amount of Tinkered Mana around it is increasing rapidly."" Tina reported from behind them. It was good to know there is no imminent danger, but everyone still did their best to free Ghanna. 

""Tina! Erect a barrier. If it attacks, we will defend first, then counterattack! Now let's free Ghanna ASAP!"" Without waiting for Zaanta to finish her order, Tina erected a spherical barrier around the group and continued observing the biped in front of her. 

As Zaanta and her group pushed for the last time, freeing Ghanna, Tina made another report. ""Mana concentration has reached stability. Prepare for a mid-tier spell."" 

""Brace yourselves! If it attacks us, prepare a counterattack as soon as Tina’s barrier fades!"" Zaanta yelled towards the group before turning to Tina directly. ""Make sure not to dispel it. Ghanna is too eager for a rematch,"" to which she received a quick nod. 

A single look at Ghanna was all she needed. She was warming up and stretching her muscles while glaring in the thing’s direction. She also had her backup weapon, a smaller mallet, in hand. 'If that thing attacks us, it's good that Ghanna is as furious as she is, but if it doesn't…' 

Her thoughts were disturbed by a distress noise coming from Tina, followed by a quick report. ""Zaanta! I don't know how, but it's gathering all the Tinkered Mana from nearby. And our barrier is made of it! I don't know if I'll be able to hold it together!"" 

'Fuck.' As soon as Zaanta thought that, she could see a tiny stream of condensed mana escape from the barrier, and fly towards the things' armored hand. Tina had to replace the lost mana as fast as she could, causing her to lie down to the ground, unable to stand. There was no-one left with their weapon sheathed, and everyone stared, awed at the creature in front of them that was able to steal mana. 

The stolen mana combined with the mana  in the air before condensing on the beings palm in some form of…crystal?! A crystal! Deep red in color, with a couple of pure white veins on top. It was levitating just slightly above the palm of the being, rotating slowly as if on display. As everyone watched it, the being took hold of the crystal with its free hand, breaking an invisible bubble that contained it. As the bubble popped open, it released a wave of Natural Mana that attempted to distribute itself evenly and flowed in all directions, including the one in which the weakened barrier was. 

Without slowing down, the mana wave shattered the fragile barrier and flowed to the edge of the clearing and beyond, to the Dendroids barrier. ‘Is this the source? Did he do it? and how? How do you change the mana tinkered by our Creators back into its natural state?’ As Zaanta thought that, Ghanna leaped past her and sprinted towards the thing, weapon in hand and yelling threats.

“You fucker! You dare to destroy Tina’s barrier?! I’ll beat you up so bad you’ll fear my kind for all eternity!” Ghana yelled at the creature in front of her as she sprinted to attack it. “Mages! Support!” A couple of spells emerged from behind Zaanta, some of them aimed towards Ghanna, others for the creature. Zaanta received a blessing of the wind, making her faster, as well as the blessing of stone, boosting her defense a little bit. The spells aimed at the creature were mostly intended to bind it in place, but all of them were resisted, only making the creature look annoyed.

“Ghanna! Come back! It didn’t attack!” Zaanta tried to stop her, but she knew it was already too late. She reluctantly stood up to follow her, just to be overtaken by the two Raakteigs that scurried past her. ‘What was that about?’ 
—--------------------------------------------------------

Ghanna pretended she didn’t hear Zaanta. She knew what she’d be told. To stop her attack, even though it was completely justified. It broke through a barrier Tina erected. Spells flew past her, and she could feel the Blessings of wind and stone affecting her. She sped up more, watching as the binding spells reached their target and failed. ‘Doesn’t matter. I’ll just chase it around,’ she thought as she swung her mallet, aiming for the knees of the creature. ‘This could cripple it enough… I don’t feel like chasing it.

The Mallet continued on its way, and Ghanna braced for the moment it impacted its knees… but it never came. The being in front of her jumped up, its knees and feet made way for the mallet to pass through. 

Ghanna was not prepared for this, so the mallet threw her off balance for a moment, exposing her side to the beast. It didn't hesitate and Ghanna got kicked away once again. She was out of breath and she almost lost the hold of her weapon, but it seemed that there was no severe damage. 

A healing spell hit her and she inhaled sharply, enjoying the air in her lungs once more. Using her mallet as a walking cane, she got up before looking at the creature that kicked her side. In the time Ghanna took to get on her legs, it picked up her first mallet and held it near its right side in one hand. The other hand held the small crystal, but it didn’t look like it would be attacking anytime soon.

Another volley of spells hit it, but none of them seemed to take effect. In fact, its armor started to repair itself little by little. The cracks started to fill in, and it didn't stop until the mana flow was cut off. ""Don’t use any more magic on that thing! It's using it to regenerate its armor!"" she yelled to the scholars as she reevaluated her tactics. 'This is troublesome. I can't use any advanced attack skills, because it would just use them to repair that armor.  But I also can't use attacks weak enough to make it lose interest in fighting me. As long as it attacks me, it won't focus on Zaanta and the others. In that case I should use empowering magic on myself to make me stronger, and attack with purely physical attacks.'

The biped in black was standing about five meters in front of her with its hands by its side. It held her mallet in its right hand, and the weird crystal in its left hand. Its feet were shoulder distance apart, with its right leg slightly in front to keep balance. Its first leg joints were bent forward, and she couldn't see the second joints or ankles. She caught a movement to her right. Two beings approached her from Zaantas direction, with weapons at the ready. 

Upon recognising them, Ghanna was a bit surprised, muttering: ""I never thought I'd be glad to see Raaketigs coming to my aid. On the other hand…"" She looked to the group of Guild members and scholars that stood in defensive formation far away. ""They are not helping at all."" She scoffed and quickly focused on the thing in front of her. 

It was preparing for an attack. Her balance was off and it wouldn't allow her to regain it. The thing began its offensive, swinging her mallet towards her. Its grip was light, almost as if asking her to intercept it before it could reach her. But she knew that would be a mistake. The swing was fast and dangerous. She had to defend! 

She pulled her mallet into a defensive position just in time to see the thing flex its forearm and wrist, adding even more speed and power to the already fast moving mallet. The impact shook her hand and made her feel numb, but she had no time to waste as the thing continued its attack. Devastating attacks rained on her from all directions, but she was able to block or deflect most of them. There were plenty of openings to attack, its technique was not at all perfect, but the strength and speed of its attacks made her focus on defending herself while retreating towards Zaanta, hoping that she'd give her better view of the creature. 

Its attack stance suddenly changed into a squatted one, but her guard blocked her field of view and Ghanna was too slow to react to the change. As the things mallet was thrusted into her abdomen with enough force to lift her from the ground and make her lose her breath, Ghanna was thrown backwards before falling to the ground and vomiting. 'Is this the end? Do I really die here just because I'm unable to use my skills and techniques?' These and other thoughts ran through her mind as she watched the thing close the distance between them with her mallet above its head. Its dark armor emitting rays of crimson energy, unable to see its eyes because of the design of its helmet. 'What are Zaanta and Tina doing?' 

Just as Ghanna thought that, a black Raaketig jumped in front of her, her arms wide open in a protective stance. Ghanna felt a pair of arms grab her and drag her away from the creature and Tina's barrier directly behind the Raaketig tamer, extending above and around her. ""Let me go and help the tamer"" she groaned and tried to free herself, but she was surprised to hear Barteools voice coming from behind her. 

""Virria is not so harmless as you might think. With Guild Master and Barrier Queen supporting her, there is nothing to worry about. Also, Guild Master asked me to get you to where she is, so stop resisting or walk there yourself."" Ghanna had nothing to say to that, so she just calmed down and while she watched the tamer, let herself be dragged back to the healers. 

—---------------

A couple of moments prior

Virria

—--------------

They were about halfway to the 'Battle Beast' and Ghanna, when what they assumed was Aragami went on the offensive. His strikes were fast and calculated, which assured Virria that it was indeed him. 

""Are you sure it's him?"" Barteool asked from beside her with a worried voice. ""It doesn't seem like that calm Aragami. Even when he fought the Curmin he was not like this."" 

""I am sure it's him. And I am pretty sure he's awake now. These attacks are way too coordinated for someone Enraged."" Just as Virria finished, both she and Barteool felt incoming communication Magic. 

""Can you hear me? This is Zaanta. Virria? Barteool? Do you have a plan?"" 

They looked at one another, before Virria answered. ""We can hear you Guild Master. We do not have a plan, but there is something I wanted to try. Could you help me with that, please?"" 

""I told you to call me Zaanta! And yes, we can, just tell us the details. Tina can hear you as well."" 

""As soon as there is an opening, I will jump in between the two of them. Aragami’s swings are fast, but I'm confident I will be able to dodge them at least twice. I would be glad if Miss Tina created a barrier behind me, so that if I'm wrong and he's not awake I'd have more time to react. If I am correct, Barteool will get Miss Ghanna out of there, or else she might attract too much of Aragamis attention."" Barteool looked at her, not believing what he was hearing and she could feel that Zaanta was worried as well. 

""That's way too many IFs. I don't know if I like it."" Zaanta retorted, but Virria had a counter argument at the ready. 

""Do you have any better idea?"" Virria asked, focused on the intense exchange in front of her. Ghanna changed direction of her retreat, and was now traveling towards Zaanta. 

""I don't."" Zaanta sighed mentally ""We will cover you. Try your best to buy us some time if things go wrong, so we can send the security force to assist in capturing it."" Zaanta cut off the connection, and Virria noticed a Speed Boost spell coming her way. 

""Don't you dare to overestimate yourself!"" Barteool yelled in her direction. ""We just got you back! Our public image would drop even lower if we lost you so soon."" Virria smiled and wanted to retort, but Aragami had other plans as he scored a hit on Ghanna, and Virria was forced to act. 

She jumped in between Aragami and Ghanna, her arms stretched wide open. She'd heard it from a lot of hero stories, how they jumped in front of the Wild beast, protecting the weak. They always seemed so…heroic and fearless. But now that she was in this situation she understood how hopeless they were. 

The mallet, raised high above Aragamis head, could smash her head to bits any moment. Her knees felt weak, and she had felt the need to vomit. But she also had to stand her ground. She had to stop him and prove that he wasn't some  mindless killing machine. She was unsure how long they stood there facing one another and staring in each other's eyes, but Aragami was the one to make the first move. He lowered the hand with the mallet slowly, releasing his grip, and letting it hit the ground with a slight *thud*. 

Virria released the breath she didn't realize she was holding, and hung her aching hands by her sides. Without looking away from Aragamis head, she slowly stepped closer and gently touched the arm that was endangering her with a mallet just moments prior. 

""Hi Aragami."" She said and smiled broadly, making sure she sounded calm and collected to calm him down if necessary. ""We've come to help."" She was fairly sure he wouldn't understand what she was saying, but the mention of his name could be the final push he needed to break free of the spell. So she decided to believe. To believe in him and his strong will. 

Aragami shifted his body slowly. He kneeled down, so that his head was on the same level as Virrias, and with his right arm he gently pulled her close to his chest, scratching the scales on the back of her head the way he did back in the camp before all this madness even began.

**The Duviri Paradox: Hotfix 33.0.5**  


**Changes** : 

  * Magus Lockdown now respects all enemies with ability immunity protections. 

    * We don’t take this change lightly, as we’re aware of its popularity, however, the persistent scenarios in which Magus Lockdown breaks the game (see fix listed just below) show us that we need to make some changes. In full transparency, we’ve let Magus Lockdown exist as an exception to the rule when it comes to CCing VIPS/bosses that are CC immune in most scenarios, and we’ve decided to make this change for the greater good. To offer a bit of insight to the issues, enemies with Overguard (Eximus, Kuva Trokarians, etc.) worked as intended and were unaffected by Magus Lockdown, while Eidolons, Kuva Clouds, and Thrax enemies (specifically during their incorporeal state) were not. Other abilities (such as Vauban’s Bastille for example) do not affect them, so we’ve adjusted Magus Lockdown to be on par with the rest. This change does not affect enemies that are affected by abilities (Demolishers, Acolytes, etc.), and they will maintain their existing interactions with the Arcane. 

    * With the above change, we have been able to fix Thrax Legatus enemies in the Undercroft falling through the map and being inaccessible (causing major progression breaks in Story and Circuit stags). This was caused by Magus Lockdown being used while the Thrax Legatus was using their incorporeal clone ability. 

  * Added a new dissolve VFX when approaching Undercroft portals. 

  * New players who chose the Duviri Path can now decorate their Dormizone! 

  * Simplified the hacking minigame during The Duviri Paradox Quest: 

    * Removed the timer - players now have unlimited time to complete it. 

    * Removed held notes - single notes will now be the only note interactions. 

  * Made the following changes to the Sun Silph (and its Silphsela resource) in Duviri: 

    * There are now 4 Silphsela “seeds” that float in the air around where the Sun Silph is located. 

    * Approaching a Sun Silph within 8 meters will cause it to let out a burst of 3 Silphsela “seeds” into the air that slowly descend overtime before blowing away with the wind. 

    * Also fixed being able to get unlimited Silphesela by standing near Sun Silphs. 

  * Made the following changes to the Dax Equitem to make the fight more engaging and challenging: 

    * Increased the rate at which they use abilities and improved their targeting logic when fighting against a squad. 

    * Slightly increased base health. 

    * Updated animations after performing abilities/leaps. 

  * Made various updates and fixes to the sound FX for Incarnon Genesis weapons. 

  * Updated the VFX for Dread’s Incarnon Mode. 




**Optimizations** : 

  * Made micro-optimizations to interactions with Duviri citizens. 




**Fixes** : 

  * Fixed only 2 of the 3 required fragments dropping for the “Assemble the Shrine” side objective if the Client initiates it while the Host is very far away - causing a halt in Spiral stage progress. 

  * Fixed Defense Target not spawning if Host Migration occurs - causing waves to halt indefinitely. 

  * Fixed dying in the Drifter Combat tutorial in The Duviri Paradox Quest causing Drifter to get locked in A pose - causing a halt in Quest progress. 

  * Fixed cases where a player with many Decrees attacking the Dax Equitem could break the fight and potentially crash. 

  * Fixed resources collected (and rewards from Enigmas) after the Orowyrm fight not being saved upon extracting. 

    * _We are also investigating the same issue when using the “Leave Duviri” menu option._

  * Fixed permanent screenshake and cleansing prompt when interacting with a Conservation animal while Transference Surge is active. 

  * Fixed Arbitrations being inaccessible due to the new Duviri navigation region. 

    * _Arbitrations, like Steel Path, are unlocked when completing all of the nodes in the Origin System and do not require Duviri interaction._

  * Fixed Clients getting permanently stuck controlling the Orowyrm after Host Migration - causing halt in progressing through the rest of the fight. 

  * Fixed customizing your Drifter via the mirror in the Dormizone erroneously offering Operator-only customization as an option to equip onto/purchase for Drifter. 

    * _If you purchased an Operator customization with the intention of using it for Drifter and would like to revert the purchase you can send a ticket to_[ _support.warframe.com_](https://digitalextremes.zendesk.com/hc/en-us) _. Use “Revert Operator Cosmetics Mirror Purchase” in the title to help our support team find your request._

  * Fixed the Undercroft portal VFX missing when approaching while riding Kaithe - causing players to think that it is not functioning. 

  * Fixed crash that could occur when Host Migrating during Hidden Chest objective in Duviri. 

  * Fixed permanently losing your thrown melee weapon if you throw it just before entering an Undercroft portal. 

  * Fixed getting randomly teleported away to a totally new location in Duviri while flying on Kaithe around the edges of the islands. 

  * Fixed Clients seeing the Dax Equitem standing inside of their horse after Host Migration. 

  * Fixed respawning in unexpected locations after Host Migration. 

  * Fixed minor hitches in the Undercroft during Host Migration. 

  * More fixes towards hitching issues in Teshin’s Cave for Clients - potentially causing players to disconnect from the squad. 

  * Fixed minor hitches across other areas of Duviri. 

  * Fixed certain Mods not appearing in Teshin’s Cave Mod Configs - notably Warframe Augment Mods for subsumed abilities. 

  * Fixed Clients experiencing wonky camera positioning after dismounting from K-Drive or Merulina. 

  * Fixed camera shifting to active waypoint after summoning K-Drive at a fair distance from it.

  * Fixed Maw flying out of the pond and roaming around after using the /unstuck command while feeding. 

  * Fixed Circuit Progress bar flashing and extending beyond UI after reaching Rank 10 in The Circuit. 

  * Fixed Steel Path Circuit Progress UI indicating different amounts earned and to earn in each window (Navigation & Mission Progress). 

  * Fixed the meteors during the Anger Spiral in Duviri not moving for Clients and immediately despawning. 

  * Fixed framerate drops when activating some of the side objectives in Duviri. 

  * Fixed Maw Feeding and Shawzin spots being highlighted during The Duviri Paradox Quest. 

    * _These side objectives are intended for post-quest completion._

  * Fixed dialogue not playing for page 3 of the “Scholar’s Landing” Lost Islands of Duviri Codex entry. 

  * Fixed Lex Prime’s magazine sticking out in the Inarnon Genesis diorama when visiting Cavelero. 

  * Fixed Clients’ Drifter A-posing while bleeding out in Duviri. 

  * More fixes towards Duviri citizens not reacting at all to the Orowyrm. Stone cold. 

  * Fixed players and Duviri citizens at times floating a bit off of the ground. 

  * Fixed Melee Incarnon Weapons using the incorrect HUD indicator to state that Incarnon Mode was ready. 

  * Fixed arrow facing the wrong way when using any skin on the Paris’ Incarnon Mode.

Socialism Worked… Much Better than Capitalism: Marxist Critique of Bourgeois Historiography and an Empirical Analysis of Developmental Outcomes

Abstract:
This article challenges the kind of capitalist historiography which painted socialism just like economic disaster, authoritarianism and also carnage. From a dialectical-materialist perspective, I argue that socialism, as practiced in the 20th century, actually achieved better outcomes in numerous areas of human development, such as literacy, health care, housing and poverty reduction, as compared to capitalism. Through the use of empirical data, the debunking of capitalistic ideological myths (mostly from the Black Book of Communism whose author later admitted that numbers and its general information is either exaggerated or even made up)., and the presentation of reams of popular support from those who experienced socialism directly, it finds that socialism worked, materially and in the real world, better than capitalism for most workers.

---

1. 
The ideological ascendancy of capitalist ideology since the latter half of the 20th century has made it taken-for-granted that socialism “failed,” and that capitalism “succeeded.” Such statements depend on generalizations that are not historically grounded, cherry-picking of data and uncritical repetition of Cold War redscare propaganda. This paper, however, undertakes a historical materialist analysis to compare the relative performances of the socialist and capitalist systems not on ideological premise but by criticizing their performance based on quantifiable developmental criteria.

---

2. 
From a materialist perspective, let's critically compare how socialism has fared compared to capitalism using the following metrics of social success:

Literacy and Educational Level

Life Expectancy and Infant Mortality

Poverty and income Inequality (Gini Index)

Access to Housing and Urban Development

Gender and Racial Equality

Public Ownership and Democratic Planning

Independence, Control and the Command of Economic Policy

These standards are based on the key Marxist criteria of the success of a social formation as one not of profitability or accumulation, but the extent to which it can meet the material and social needs of the working class.

Socialist Gains

3.1 Literacy and Education

From UNESCO Data, in 1975 socialist Cuba achieved a 99.8% literacy rate – higher than that of the United States in and most other Countries. Adult illiteracy was eliminated in the USSR within two decades of the October Revolution, while in capitalist countries such as India and Brazil mass illiteracy remained a social problem well into the 21st century.

3.2 
Healthcare and Mortality

Average life expectancy in the USSR in 1989 was also 70 years, the same as in many other Western countries, despite a significantly lower per capita GDP. Socialist health care systems provided universal access; in Cuba,  life expectancy is now over 78 years, higher than in a number of zones within the United States.

3.3 
Poverty and Inequality

Half a century ago, Eastern Bloc countries enjoyed some of the lowest Gini coefficients in the world (0.23–0.28), whereas today the United States is one of the most unequal advanced economies (0.41, World Bank, 2023) for instance Indian capitalism, (where) 10 per cent of the population owns over 77 percent of the wealth of the entire country, which they accumulated over decades of economic “growth”.

3.4 
Housing and Employment

In the majority of socialist countries, housing and employment rights were constitutionally guaranteed. For instance, in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) there was no homelessness, and everyone had access to state-subsidized housing. Homelessness is endemic in the United States – there are more than 650,000 homeless people on any given night (U.S. HUD, 2023) – and job insecurity.

Busting Capitalist Lies About Socialist ""Crimes""
4.1 The Myth of “One Hundred Million Deaths”

The number, often referred to as one popularized by the Black Book of Communism, is not based on rigorous methodology, often blurring the lines between wartime deaths, famines and even natural disasters and the toll of political repression. By contrast, capitalism’s kill count, from colonial genocides and neoliberal austerity to preventable not-prevented Deaths, is still systemically underreported.

Capitalist Colonialism (Belgian Congo, British India) also killed tens of millions of people. So, too, the Bengal Famine of 1943 could not be torn away from British policy itself the evocation of 3-4 million deaths which is never.

Imperialist Wars: The Vietnam War, the Korean War, and U.S. interventions in Latin America led to the death of millions of civilians, only to stop socialist movements (but people still believes that Capitalism doesn't need force to exist)
.
Global Inequality and Structural Violence: UN rapporteur Jean Ziegler indicted in a 2011 report that more than 36 million people die annually from poverty-related and hunger-related causes, a death toll that is socially avoidable and a byproduct of profit structures under capitalism.

4.2. 
Holodomor and Great Leap Forward

Tragic as it is, such events need to be viewed from an accurate perspective:
Holodomor (1932–1933) took place in a situation of active class resistance, internal sabotage, U.S Sanctions, and geopolitical encirclement. Western scholars like Mark Tauger dispute the idea of intentional genocide and point to other causes, such as environmental and administrative ones.

The Great Leap Forward (1958-61) was associated with huge famine, but its extent and causes continue to be disputed. Compare this with the post-independence famines in India under capitalism, the failure to reform agrarian relations with chronic undernourishment among over 190 million Indians today (FAO 2022).

---

5. 
The Public:

Despite capitalist triumphalism, older generations of people who have lived under socialism answer all kinds of questions positively about the previous socialist system:

According to a 2020 Pew Research Center poll, 72% of East Germans feel that life was better under socialism than in unified capitalist Germany.
According to a 2018 Levada Center poll, 66% of Russians regretted the disintegration of the USSR and wished it back in socialist hands.
Yugoslav states Serbia and Bosnia exhibit relentless nostalgia for the Tito-era socialist federation, with its era of full employment, stability, and decent life.

These are not sentimentalities- they are material assessments by those who lived through the Socialist regimes.

SOCIALISM IS A FAR SUPERIOR ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETY

The paper has shown, by history’s standard and empirical indicators, that socialism worked better than capitalism in a wide range of important respects/domains, including satisfaction of needs, education, health, and social welfare. The failures of socialism, though real, have to be considered within a spectrum of structural pressures: Cold War sabotage, external blockades and post-revolutionary tumult. Capitalism, on the other hand, obscures its atrocities with the mantel of “freedom” and is committed to inequality and systemic underdevelopment as well as ecological destruction.

""Socialism worked much better than capitalism” is not a rhetorical provocation, it’s a concrete fact that is based on material experience, quantifiable facts and the lived experiences of millions of people. What we need now, however, is not to romanticize the past, but instead to recover the emancipatory potential of the socialist legacy for a world in turmoil.

2021-12-17 13:02:06,"This disclosed document from the Vatican Secret Archives reveals the true horrors of the Spanish Inquisition. *The following document was written by Father Maximus Vazquez during the Spanish Inquisition. Tasked with uncovering heretics in Barcelona, Father Maximus became notorious for his cruel treatment of Muslim and Jewish immigrants. By all accounts, his ability to elicit confessions through torture was unmatched in all of Spain.*

*Only one woman, a Jewish heretic named Talia, mustered the courage to endure his torture chamber.*

*What follows is Father Vazquez’s horrific response to her bravery.*

\---

I’m at my wit’s end. I’ve been interrogating the same woman for two weeks, but she still refuses to decry her heresy. How she has endured my pincers and *strappado* for so long, I do not know. She hasn’t opened her mouth once during her time in my chamber. It’s as if she is unable to feel pain.

A priest with less experience would take her courage as a sign of God’s grace.

But not I.

Her disdain for Catholicism clogs the air and fills her eyes every time she gazes upon the tapestry of the passion draped behind my desk.

So tomorrow, I will put her through my true test: exposure to The Artifact.

It’s been years since I’ve used The Artifact, but I can’t think of a more opportune moment. For who better to expose to the horrors of Hell than such an insolent woman?

I pray that her descent into madness comes slowly. I want to savor her despair—savor the crumbling of her faith.

Tomorrow cannot come soon enough.

\---

My hands are shaking as I write this. Not only am I fatigued, but my mind burns with questions.

The heretic’s reaction to The Artifact perplexes me. Never before have I seen such an intense response to the pagan chalice.

Perhaps by relating my experience on this tattered page, I will make sense of what seems unexplainable on the surface.

I entered my chamber just before sunrise to find the heretic asleep in her chains. Her restful face filled me with anger. Burns and lacerations covered her body. That she could endure the inflictions of my instruments—many of which I forged myself—challenged my ability to perform my holy duties. Given that I’m the most revered inquisitor in Spain, I cannot allow peasants to make a mockery of my art.

I must succeed where others fail. My work is God’s work.

To fail means to tarnish God’s glory.

So I approached the heretic on silent feet and lowered The Artifact to her lips.

Her eyes flew open as liquid splashed onto her tongue.

“Spill a drop,” I said, “and I will break your legs.”

Not wanting to test the truthfulness of my threat, the heretic allowed me to drain The Artifact down her throat.

Her chains clanked as her legs flailed. The Artifact makes any liquid it touches frigid, so the freezing water caused her to writhe against the wall.

I couldn’t help but smile at her discomfort. Seeing the pain reflected in her face gave me hope that she would soon confess her crimes against the Church, which I suspected were great.

Once the chalice was empty, I raised it from her lips and placed it on the ground behind me.

What happened next, I hardly have the will to write—for it represents the closest to Hell I have ever been.

The heretic grew very still. She cocked her head to the side, concealing her features with her hair.

Now that her thrashing had ceased, I took notice of the fetid stench drifting from her spoiled clothes. The odor was so overpowering I nearly gagged.

Had she smelled so terribly the day before?

Before I had long to dwell on this question, she leaped to her feet and stared at me with blood-filled eyes.

I returned her gaze for what felt like an infinite stretch of time.

Then, just as my concern for her erratic behavior reached its peak, she reared back her head and laughed.

Her laughter was piercing—like a child’s shriek—and echoed around the room with deafening volume.

My skin crawled at the sound. Typically, my subjects break down in tears as The Artifact tortures them with visions of Hell. Although these visions are powerful, they are nothing more than mental images. The forces of Hell cannot consume their souls while they still draw breath, despite their vulnerability.

However, none of the subjects I have exposed to The Artifact have ever laughed during their descent. Typically, their bodies go numb from shock, with their minds soon to follow.

I’ve even had subjects gnaw off their tongues.

You can imagine my apprehension then as the heretic continued her raucous laughter.

“Enough!” I said, taking a step toward her. “Your disrespect knows no bounds. I will teach you to make a mockery of my procedures.”

I raised my hand to strike her. But right as I moved my palm toward her cheek, my arm froze as if grabbed by invisible fingers.

The heretic smiled. “Your taunts are amusing,” she said. “As are the visions you have gifted me with.”

Fear constricted my chest as the fingers tightened to the point I could feel bruises forming on my arms. Such a profound feeling of hopelessness pervaded my spirit, I felt like slumping to the ground.

“What are you doing to me?” I said.

The heretic ignored my question. “I’ve been preparing for this moment for five years,” she said. “Your crimes against my people span decades. This is your punishment.”

She wrapped her hands around my neck. The moment her fingers touched my skin, blackness consumed my vision.

“Don’t resist,” said the heretic. “Your fate has already been sealed.”

When my vision returned, I found myself standing at the precipice of a boiling yellow lake. A sprawling black castle loomed beyond this lake, spires stretching miles into the air.

I tried to flee—to escape this hellish world and return to my chamber—but my feet whisked me toward a nearby bridge.

The heretic’s laughter exploded through the blackness as I walked.

\---

When I reached the obsidian bridge, I noticed corpses floating along the lake. Lesions lined their scalded skin, which glowed yellow from the water’s radiance. Their eyes laid in melted puddles on their cheeks.

I turned away. Not even during my three decades as an inquisitor had I witnessed such a gruesome sight. These corpses looked ancient—as if they had been rotting in the rancid water for millennia, never decaying, never sinking.

I glanced down at my feet in silent consternation. No matter how hard I tried to prevent my legs from moving, I maintained my brisk pace despite the bridge’s unevenness.

The thought of the unholy powers governing my body caused me to shiver. What unnatural abilities did the heretic possess to transport me to such a hellish scene?

*I’ve been preparing for this moment for five years.*

The heretic’s words filled my mind, striking my heart with fear. If such a disturbing statement was true, then she had placed herself willingly inside my torture chamber.

The implications of her arrival quickened my breathing. Rumors about satanic rituals and sabbats occurring on the outskirts of the city swirled through Barcelona. Was the heretic the product of these rumors? Had her people grown so desperate to free themselves from the Church’s influence that they had turned their back on God, placing their faith in her instead to facilitate their unholy revenge?

If demented spirits had already possessed the heretic, then The Artifact couldn’t control her.

Not even God could control her.

The realization that I was now in Hell dawned on me. Whether my imprisonment was temporary or permanent eluded my quivering mind.

All I knew was that I couldn’t bear standing on the bridge for a moment longer. The steam billowing from the searing water burned my skin and made me feel like I might pass out. I imagined tumbling over the ledge as darkness overcame me, limbs too weak to catch myself before I plunged into the water.

The thought of regaining consciousness in the boiling lake filled me with dread.

So I jogged forward with what little remained of my strength.

Although the bridge stretched for over a mile, the castle at its end dominated the skyline. This castle was gothic in appearance and so black that the light produced by the infernos raging behind its windows burned no brighter than ordinary candles.

Despite the castle’s cruel appearance—and the dread it stirred within me—I couldn’t help but stare at it. Never before had I seen such an exquisite piece of architecture. Each buttress and façade wound into the cliffside with mathematical perfection that dwarfed even the Italian’s remarkable skill.

It was while traversing this bridge that I learned beauty exists even in Hell.

My lungs burned from the force of my exertion. However, my position on the bridge had remained mostly unchanged. Was a supernatural power tainting my progress, or was the bridge longer than my aching eyes had predicted?

Both possibilities frightened me equally.

Regardless, I had no choice but to push forward. A menacing black cloud materialized at the bridge’s foot not long after I stepped onto the jagged path. Every few moments, a guttural scream exploded from this cloud, betraying the prisoners housed therein. Not wanting to add my voice to this chaotic menagerie, I increased my pace.

The castle piqued my curiosity.

I wanted to know the secrets that it housed, regardless of the risk that entering it surely posed. Countless scholars throughout the centuries—including my friend Father Bonnard—had speculated about the true nature of Hell. And now that the opportunity to uncover this secret loomed directly in front of my face, why not take the daring plunge that must accompany all serious pursuits of knowledge and enter the castle? Surely God would reward my courage.

I noticed a figure leaning against a pillar through the steam. This figure moaned as I approached as if it were in pain.

“Help me,” said the figure, voice just above a whisper. “Please.”

Mist enshrouded its face. Although it appeared human, six limbs sprang from its torso, giving it a spider-like appearance.

I paused, too afraid to traverse the mist and witness its true form.

“What is your purpose?” I said. “Why are you loitering in such an unholy place?”

The figure inhaled a raspy breath before responding. “I escaped the castle,” it said. “But I ran out of strength before I could cross the bridge.”

“Where are we?” I said.

“In Hell.”

“Where in Hell?”

“Queen Araceli’s castle.”

Although I had read numerous books about demonology, I had never heard the name.

“Who is Queen Araceli?”

“A fallen angel, like most who rule this realm. Beyond that, her history is unknown to me. My eyes never gazed upon her rumored beauty. I was imprisoned in the catacombs deep beneath the castle.”

“Who are you?”

“I was once a sinner—just like you. And like all sinners, I was sent here to be punished for the rest of eternity.”

“How did you escape your imprisonment?”

The figure was silent for nearly a minute. “At great cost,” it finally said. “Which is why you must help me. My freedom cannot be so short-lived! It’s been millennia since my limbs have been free and light has greeted my eyes.”

“Why should I help you? You’re a sinner—you deserve your fate.”

“Damning words for a man whose fate will soon mirror my own. Are you not also standing at Hell’s gate?”

I blushed. “I’m not supposed to be here. God willing, I will return to my chambers before my colleagues notice my absence.”

“I’m not supposed to be here, either, and yet here I am.”

A deafening sloshing sound exploded to my right. I turned my head and stumbled backward when I saw over a dozen corpses snaking through the lake toward the figure.

The figure started whimpering the moment it saw them.

“Our Father, who art in Heaven,” it said, voice raspy with tears, “hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on Earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day our—”

Its voice morphed into a shriek as the corpses slithered onto the bridge and wrapped their scalded hands around its limbs. It tried to pull away—to flee in my direction—but the corpses were too powerful. They dragged it beneath the lake’s surface before I had time to react.

To this moment, I wonder if I would’ve had the courage to intervene on its behalf.

An eerie silence overtook the bridge.

I glanced toward the castle.

When I saw that its gate was now open, my heart quickened.

I jogged forward, fingers instinctively grabbing the cross dangling from my neck.

\---

The air turned frigid the closer I got to the gate. I tightened my cloak around my shoulders and continued jogging. The gate was no more than a few hundred feet away. If I maintained my brisk pace, then I would reach it in a matter of minutes.

Periodically, I glanced toward the lake, fearful that the corpses might ascend the bridge once more and drag me into the rolling water. The panicked shrieks the entity bellowed as its assailants pulled it from the bridge still haunted my ears. Just the thought of the tortures it was enduring caused me to shudder.

No matter how hard I strained my eyes, I couldn’t see through the mist billowing beyond the castle’s portcullis. The same shade of yellow as the lake, this mist passed through the air like a heavy cloud and bathed the bridge’s stones with phosphorescent condensation.

I couldn’t help but dwell on the wonders (and horrors) housed beyond this mist. The castle stretched miles into the air and, based on the barred windows snaking along its walls, possessed thousands of rooms. How many souls claimed these rooms as their final resting place? How many sinners cried out to God as the denizens of Hell inflicted unimaginable tortures upon them? Did God even hear their cries, or did their prayers become ensnared in the black, starless sky looming above the castle’s spires, never to reach Heaven’s splendor?

These questions and a thousand more swam through my mind as I jogged. Although the fear of where I now was threatened to block out all reason, not even this fear could silence my scholar’s curiosity. The knowledge I could gain by exploring the castle surpassed a lifetime of studying scripture.

I couldn’t let such a valuable opportunity slip through my fingers, regardless of the terror coursing through my body like liquified opium.

However, a part of me feared that the heretic *wanted* me to enter the castle—that passing through the raised portcullis meant walking straight into her trap. She had transported me to this bridge for a reason, hadn’t she? And based on the pleasure in her eyes as she throttled me into blackness, this reason was clear: suffering.

The heretic wanted me to suffer—to punish me for my “crimes” against her people.

But try as she might to force me into despair, my tenacity refused to buckle. I carried God within my breast.

And not even Satan dared to challenge a man of God.

\---

I paused in front of the portcullis, skin stinging from the mist. Yellowness dominated my senses. Not even my keen eyes could cut through the fog—the room beyond the gate was beyond my discernment.

“Welcome, Father Vazquez,” said a woman’s voice from within the castle.

I froze. I tried to locate the source of the voice, but the mist was so thick I couldn’t see my hand in front of my face.

“Show yourself,” I said. “So that we can converse as equals.”

The mist sank into the floor. Its disappearance was so sudden that it took my eyes several moments to adjust to the room’s reduced light.

When they did, I saw the most beautiful woman I had ever seen standing at the foot of a sprawling yellow staircase.

“Who are you?” I said.

The woman smiled at me.

A rattling echo boomed above my head. I glanced upwards just in time to see two hooks plummeting from the ceiling.

I screamed as these hooks dug into my back and hoisted me into the air.

“Embrace the pain,” said the woman. “For pain will soon become your eternal companion.”

Tears filled my eyes as blood gushed down my back. Never before had I experienced such intense agony. I felt like knives were grating my spine and resisted the urge to pass out.

Despite the pain dominating my awareness, I cursed myself for entering the castle. Underestimating the heretic—and the castle’s ability to sense my approach—was the ultimate act of hubris.

I vowed never to make such a damning mistake again.

I slumped my shoulders, trying to relieve the pressure building in my back. But this spasmodic movement caused the hooks to sink even deeper into my flesh, doubling my pain.

I offered up a desperate prayer to God to save me from my fate—to forgive me for the transgressions damning me to the abyss. But his voice remained silent, intensifying my despair.

“God is dead,” said the woman. “Praying is useless.”

“Release me,” I said, voice hoarse.

The woman laughed. “Mercy does not exist here. Your journey through my castle will be an arduous one. You will beg for death before it is over, but death will not save you.”

The chains attached to the hook lurched forward. My neck whiplashed, filling my eyes with stars.

“God *damn* you!” I shouted. “You have no right.”

“I have *every* right,” said the woman. “Do you think you are the first priest to dangle from those hooks? My domain is home to more priests than stars in the sky. My castle is Heaven, and Hell is just beyond those doors.” She pointed at the massive red doors at the end of the room. “Welcome home.”

The chains groaned as they propelled me toward the doors. I wrapped my hands around their burning iron and attempted to pull the hooks from my back. But my effort was laughable and robbed me of the little strength I still possessed.

The doors opened, revealing a cavernous tunnel that wound deep into the castle.

I closed my eyes as I began my descent.

\---

My head throbbed as I sank so deep beneath the castle light became a distant memory. How far I traveled will forever remain a mystery to me. Time slid by in imperceptible chunks, leaving me with nothing but my tortured thoughts as I slithered through the twisted crags of Hell.

But eventually, even my mind ceased its standard inquiries, and a languid stupor overcame me.

This stupor would’ve outlasted the decaying of my body had my chains not whisked me into a vast chasm overlooking a yellow ocean.

I do not use the word ocean lightly. The body of water undulating beneath my feet stretched for miles and emanated a pulsing yellow glow blinding with its brilliance.

My chains lowered me toward the water with painful slowness. The angle at which I descended drove my chains against my sternum, robbing me of breath.

By the time my feet reached the water, I was gasping for air, begging God to rid me of the oppressor ensnaring my chest.

However, had I known the torture awaiting me in the chasm, I would’ve prayed for a quick and painless death.

After passing within ten feet of the water, my chains vanished, sending my plummeting toward its boiling surface.

Incinerating pain consumed me as the murky water enveloped my skin. I tried to push myself to the shore, but my kicking was useless. The water was so dense it restricted upward movement. All my struggles accomplished was moving me deeper into the rotten bay.

I inhaled water as burns set my nerves ablaze. Acidic liquid ravaged every one of my pores, causing me to writhe with agony.

Despite rationality begging me to do the contrary, I opened my eyes. To my surprise, pain did not greet them, but icy coolness. It was as if the boiling acid could only affect my skin. I squinted against the harsh yellow glow and surveyed my surroundings.

What I saw sent a wave of panic creeping across my chest.

Thousands of poor souls were submerged in the acid, spaced at six feet intervals. Based on the deterioration of their bodies, most of these prisoners had been held captive for millennia.

I darted my eyes back toward the surface. Fifteen feet of acid separated me from freedom. However, this minuscule gap might as well have been miles. I could no more travel through the rancid liquid than I could silence my roaring heart.

Fear dominated my being as my lungs deflated ever further. By my count, it had been five minutes since my last breath. Why didn’t consciousness elude me? Surely my panic was severe enough to hasten my asphyxiation.

It was while contemplating this startling phenomenon that I had a chilling revelation.

In Hell, the dead don’t drown.

Instead, they suffocate for an eternity, never breathing, never dying.

The thought that the miserable wretches squirming around me had not drawn breath in years, *centuries*, was too much for me to bear. I was a man of God for Christ’s sake. Did my piety count for nothing?

The husks of the damned flailed around me in silent agony. How long did I have before my limbs withered, and my mind soured? A year? Ten? Each moment ushered an infinitude of misery and despair. Not even the strongest of wills could endure such unbearable torture for more than a few hours.

If I was truly in Hell, then surely my corporeality was a façade—a physical manifestation of my incorporeal soul. Flesh and blood cannot follow the soul into the afterlife.

So why did I suffer as if I were still in Spain?

Such questions were best reserved for the metaphysicians of the world. Although I had spent a lifetime studying Aristotle and Aquinas, my line of work demanded my focus on practical truths, not lofty conjectures. And besides, oxygen deprivation threatened to rob me of consciousness at any moment.

Contemplating philosophical questions was near impossible.

I closed my eyes. A hundred lamentations formed in my mind, but I was too weary to offer them up to God.

Instead, I sank into the deepest recesses of my hopelessness, where neither thoughts nor dreams could follow.

A disconcerting screech echoed through the water, forcing my eyes open. I glanced toward the ocean’s depths, curious as to the origin of this jarring sound.

When I saw six corpses racing through the water toward my feet, I let forth a gurgled scream.

Twelve hands clasped my legs, bruising my skin. I reached for their jagged nails, but the dense water made it impossible for me to repel their fingers.

Silent despair consumed me as they dragged me, inch by inch, toward the ocean’s bottom.

How long we descended will forever elude me. Time passed in laborious strokes, forging my fear into desolate blackness.

After we sank for so long the acid encasing my skin ceased to elicit pain, a mountain-sized crag appeared through the hazy water. Rugged black stones encircled this crag, which towered through the water like charred, gargantuan bones.

Pale, yellow light drifted from the crag’s interior. The source of this light evaded my irritated eyes. Regardless, I could feel myself yearning to come in contact with its warm glow, as if allowing the furtive yellowness to embrace me would free me from Hell’s torments.

My captors whisked me through the crag’s opening. To my surprise, an invisible barrier prevented the water from crossing the rocky threshold. The black stones spanning the walls were bone dry.

I landed on these stones with spine-shattering force. However, I was too busy sucking in deep gulps of air to notice the pain spiraling up my back.

My hands shook as I hoisted myself to my feet.

“What is this place?” I said. “Where have you taken me?”

“They’ve taken you to the final resting place of priests,” said a woman’s voice to my right. “Where God’s stewards reap their final rewards.”

I turned just in time to see Queen Araceli descending from a spiraling, yellow staircase looming beyond the crag’s entrance.

“You do not frighten me, temptress,” I said. “My faith in God is unwavering. I refuse to succumb to your blasphemies.”

“Refuse away. Your will means nothing here, nor do your beliefs. Only pain exists where you’re going. Pain and darkness.”

The stone obscuring the path ahead rolled away, revealing a cavernous chamber filled with blinding yellow light.

Once my eyes adjusted to this sudden change in luminosity, a terror so profound assaulted them that I collapsed to my knees.

A man, a thousand times larger than any God had created, crouched in the middle of this chamber. His features were jagged and angular as if his bones were made of shattered glass. A radiant yellow crown sat upon his head. Other than that, he was naked.

Beneath his feet stretched a line of priests further than my eyes could see. A crown of thorns sat atop each priest’s head, puncturing their temples and sending blood pouring down their chests.

The giant scooped up the priest at the line’s front with surprising dexterity and swallowed him whole. The priest’s panicked screams reverberated around the chamber long after he vanished from sight, drowning out the mournful cries of his companions still awaiting their fates.

I glanced at the monstrosity’s bulbous stomach.

My skin writhed when I saw thousands of hands and feet pressing against his skin, trying desperately to tear through their fleshy prison.

But the giant’s skin held firm, even as he hunched down and surveyed the line with a crooked smile.

“Behold my son,” said Queen Araceli. “Isn’t he magnificent? His might is known all through Hell.”

Gore spilled down the giant’s chest he as he gnawed off a priest’s head.

“This isn’t real,” I said. “It can’t be. God would never allow such barbarism.”

“God’s power ends in Heaven. You’re in my domain now and forever.”

A metal spike erupted from the wall behind me, exploding through my stomach. Blood pooled in my mouth as the iron’s icy coldness snaked through my intestines.

I stared down at my wound, face wracked with shock. Twelve hours ago found me lounging on my bed, reading the Bible. How could my destiny take such a gruesome turn in such a short period? Did my faith count for nothing? Had I been a fool to believe in a God who didn’t believe in me?

“Embrace your pain,” said Queen Araceli. “The discomfort caused by that spike is temporary. Once my son consumes you, your screams will outnumber the stars in Heaven.”

This spike, hastened by an invisible force, lifted me into the air and bore me toward the chamber.

“You can’t do this to me!” I said, attempting to free myself from my skewer. “I am a man of *God*!”

“You are a man,” said Queen Araceli, “and nothing more.”

The giant eyed me hungrily as I hurtled toward his mouth. Less than twenty feet separated us; I could already smell his teeth’s sickening stench.

How many priests had been crushed by his putrid molars? How many prayers had been silenced by his swollen, flapping tongue?

“God,” I said, voice choked by blood, “why have You forsaken me?”

Tears flowed openly down my cheeks as I passed into the giant’s mouth. The overwhelming scent of death consumed me as I faded away into blackness.

\---

I regained consciousness beneath a tree on the outskirts of Barcelona.

Folded on my lap was the following note:

*Father Vazquez,*

*The only reason you still draw breath is because murder is the gravest of sins. Even you, who have ruined the lives of so many of our people, deserve a second chance.*

*Use this opportunity wisely.*

*For if you don’t, I will return.*

*Talia*

Before I had long to reflect on the heretic’s note, a bush jostled to my right. I wheeled my head around just in time to see a boy no older than fourteen pass into the clearing.

“Who are you?” I said, voice weak from the fear still coursing through my veins.

“My name is Claudius,” he said. “Only I can save you from the fate you’ve just witnessed. If you care to save your soul, meet me at the city’s gates at dawn.”

His words filled my mind with infinite burning questions.

But before I had the chance to speak, he disappeared back into the undergrowth.

\---

It is nearing dawn as I write this. Reason tells me to avoid the boy—to explain away his existence as nothing more than the figment of an over-excited imagination.

But the wisdom reflected in his eyes begs me to do the contrary.

If the pilgrimage inflicted on me by the heretic is an accurate depiction of the afterlife, then I must do *something* to save myself from such an unbearable fate.

Whoever this Claudius is, his face reflects God’s grace. For this reason alone, I must visit him.

The sun is rising.

2018-07-17 22:59:03,"[Spoiler] All Lore for Solstice Armor Sets Hi all! [As detailed in my other post](https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/8zpmka/spoiler_all_new_items_from_123_api_files_update/) going over all of the new and changed items, every piece of rare or legendary Solstice armor has its own lore tab. Here's all of them, compiled:

*Edit: All Done! Enjoy!*

As stated in the OP, each of the pieces of Solstice Armor has its own Lore. They appear to give a few different perspectives on what happened after the Tower fell. Super interesting.

Here's the rundown:

#Titan Rare Set

**Solstice Helm (Rekindled)** ([Item](https://light.gg/db/items/2897466191/solstice-helm-rekindled/))

> Stare into the sun and get burned.
> 
> ""Zavala, we did it! The shields are down!""
> 
> The Titan Vanguard looked to the sky. That Ghost was right: The topaz glow of the Cabal command ship's shields flickered and disintegrated. Zavala wasn't a man who smiled often, but there were a lot of firsts today.
> 
> ""All friendlies, focus fire on that capital ship! The Tower does not fall today!"" He launched himself from behind cover, weapon snapping to his shoulder, the not-smile still curling his lip. These Cabal were going to learn—
> 
> Severed.
> 
> It was like lava on his chest. Shock, pain, anger, emptiness. The breath rushed from his lungs, and his weapon clattered to the ground. The sounds of war buzzed into quiet. But no matter—he'd been lower than this. And his fists of thunder were more dangerous than any rifle. He drew upon the Light, and... nothing.
> 
> His eyes widened. He froze for an instant... and a Cabal slug took him in the side.
> 
> The Light is gone, he thought. Over and over. The Light is gone. Then: You're their leader. They need you. Now more than ever. Get up. Get up!
> 
> He roared in defiance, lurching back to his feet. He would see them all safe. Even if it meant his life.

**Solstice Gauntlets (Rekindled)** ([Item](https://light.gg/db/items/757630934/solstice-gauntlets-rekindled/))

> Sometimes the battle burns you up.
> 
> Amanda was quiet, but Zavala could still hear the anger before her voice came back over the comms. ""Due respect, Commander, I ain't got time to come be your chauffeur. There are thousands of people like me stranded down there in the City.""
> 
> ""The City is lost."" He hated saying it, but he knew it in his bones. ""And we're all the same now, Holliday. The Light is gone. We have to regroup.""
> 
> ""You mean run."" Even angrier now. It was infectious.
> 
> ""I mean live to fight another day. We don't have the luxury of rescue flights anymore. The longer we stay here, the tighter the noose.""
> 
> ""Then go! What's stopping you? You know how to fly a ship.""
> 
> ""Not like you. You're the best pilot in the system, Amanda. And you're the only one who can keep our ships in the air once we're away from Earth.""
> 
> ""Dammit, sir, we can't just leave them here.""
> 
> ""I've already made my decision. If humanity is to survive..."" He'd leave the betting to Cayde, but he knew the odds were slim. ""This is the only choice we have.""
> 
> Silence. For a few seconds this time. ""All right."" Her voice cracked. He understood.

**Solstice Plate (Rekindled)** ([Item](https://light.gg/db/items/1021217306/solstice-plate-rekindled/))

> Memories of the City burn in your heart.
> 
> He made himself look at the numbers. Seventy-three ships lost in the exodus. Seventy-three ships full of people looking to him for guidance. Guardians and civilians alike. All Zavala could give them was a noble death.
> 
> Almost none of the vessels had been outfitted with weapons. Transports and supply skiffs, barely holding together outside Earth's atmosphere, trying to punch through a fortified Red Legion blockade. Like prey animals limping through a pack of lions. It was a massacre.
> 
> The only reason the fleet made it past the Moon was because the Red Legion focused so heavily on Earth. In that, they seemed like the Cabal Zavala knew. Single-minded. Incapable of thinking more than a few moves ahead. But he knew this Dominus Ghaul wouldn't give up that easily. So they kept moving.
> 
> But what next? Zavala had a plan, of course. He always had a plan, Titan Vanguard or no. But what he really needed was information. He needed—
> 
> ""Deputy Commander Sloane, reporting for duty, sir.""
> 
> Zavala closed his eyes. And for a brief moment, he relaxed.

**Solstice Greaves (Rekindled)** ([Item](https://light.gg/db/items/1969910192/solstice-greaves-rekindled/))

> Go swift as a steed newly awakened.
> 
> ""Guardians: The City is lost. If there is any Light left in the system... we rally on Titan. Be brave.""
> 
> Zavala released the record button and looked to the two of them again. Sloane's face revealed nothing, as usual. Amanda was faking an encouraging look. He sighed. ""You don't like that one either.""
> 
> Amanda looked at Sloane, then back to Zavala, clearly not sure what to say. It was Sloane who spoke. ""Sir, you want your message to inspire this new resistance. The language you use is..."" She was trapped between her usual loyalty and her usual bluntness.
> 
> ""You make it sound like we've already lost."" Amanda said, her hand hovering over the delete button. Zavala raised an eyebrow. She wasn't trapped by anything.
> 
> ""Holliday's right, Commander. We're not burning the bulk of our fuel supply to get to Saturn and turtle up. You said it: We're going there to rally. People need something to rally to.""
> 
> He looked down at the recorder for a long moment. When he spoke, his eyes were still downcast. ""They need to know the truth. I owe them that. Activate the beacon.""

**Solstice Mark (Rekindled)** ([Item](https://light.gg/db/items/245110123/solstice-mark-rekindled/))

> Battle scars may burn and leave a mark.
> 
> ""Confirmed, sir. Nearly one hundred percent of the Arcology is infested. And... we lost both teams.""
> 
> Zavala didn't turn to face Sloane. He just stared at the rise and fall of the methane oceans.
> 
> ""But we know our enemy now, Commander. We may not have our Light, but we have the advantage. Give the order, and we'll storm the place. Burn it all down if we have to. The Hive deserve nothing less.""
> 
> ""I was a fool to come here. In the shadow of our worst enemy."" He looked up to the hole in Saturn's rings, his back still to her. ""I thought the strength of our resolve and the treasures of the Golden Age were more powerful than whatever fuels those... demons.""
> 
> Sloane hated hearing him talk like this, but it was the only way he seemed to talk these days. ""You weren't wrong, sir. It may be the only place in the system the Cabal won't go. A perfect launching pad for us to strike back. We'll suppress the Hive, and—""
> 
> ""Pull them out. All of them. Get them back to safety, and post guards on our side of the bridge.""
> 
> ""Commander—""
> 
> ""Dismissed.""

#Titan Legendary Set

**Solstice Helm (Resplendent)** ([Item](https://light.gg/db/items/3915635973/solstice-helm-resplendent/))

> Sometimes you have to become the weapon.
> 
> ""Bah."" The Red Legion invader said something in its unknowable language. It gestured with its right hand toward a Guardian who lay still, groaning and trying to get up. Even from his perch on the balcony above, Theus-7 knew mockery when he saw it.
> 
> Below him, chaos. Crowds cowered in the archways of collapsing buildings. Cabal rampaged around the open courtyard, shooting and throwing and overturning. Nothing, no one in their way was untouched. The Cabal closest to Theus drew his sidearm, aiming at the still-sputtering Guardian beside him.
> 
> Theus drew his hand cannon and got the shot off before it could, then got a clean shot on another Cabal terrorizing a group of children. It wasn't long before the Red Legion focused fire on the balcony—he was a Sentinel, though, and he knew what to do.
> 
> He leapt down, drawing on the power of the Light to form his shie—
> 
> But the Light's gone out.
> 
> The air left his body. The ugly face of the Red Legion got closer. Nothing left to do.
> 
> He shouted at the crowd to run as he primed a grenade.

**Solstice Gauntlets (Resplendent)**

> If you can't have a blast, make one.
> 
> Beneath a dead tree, Esta Tel scanned the bridge above her as she hurried to fasten the wires at the end of the cable to her detonator. Looked good. Bare road on one end of the bridge, buildings in the way on the other, but everything looked clear from down in the ravine.
> 
> The Cabal would be making a run in exactly three minutes. Time to go.
> 
> She watched the buildings up above, listening. Heard engine sounds.
> 
> When she saw a vehicle come into view, she clicked the detonator. Ten seconds.
> 
> But it wasn't Cabal. It was a medical vehicle. Moving fast onto the bridge.
> 
> Five seconds. All the blood drained from her face. She decided before she knew what she was doing.
> 
> Shouldered her sniper rifle. Aimed for the junction of her wire and the explosives under the bridge. Shot it out. The wire fell as the medical vehicle crossed.
> 
> In the distance, she heard the Cabal coming. Finally.
> 
> Shoot the explosives.
> 
> Click. No more rounds. No time to think.

**Solstice Plate (Resplendent)**

> Finish what you begin, at your own pace, with a focus unmatched.
> 
> Lyria Graemer shoved herself further into the nook underneath a cable support and looked down, waiting for Mattox-9 to make his way up. As he climbed using the fasteners she'd driven into the wall of the Tower, he met her eyes and gave a thumbs-up.
> 
> Eight more stories and they'd be right below the Speaker and the Cabal brutes who held him. Just a little further.
> 
> Graemer heard distant popping and saw puffs of smoke from below. Looking down, she saw Red Legion troops on the ground, firing up at them.
> 
> She looked to Mattox. He nodded.
> 
> ""Climb!"" she said, drawing her rifle. He reached her ready to crack a joke—she knew that face—but the clang of metal on metal interrupted him. Mattox's head shot forward, and as it snapped back up, the red light of his eyes flickered to black. Graemer's rifle fell from her hands as she hauled his body up—they could still finish this together.
> 
> Shots all around her. She snarled as one caught her in the side. The Cabal weren't letting up.
> 
> Graemer activated her grenades and loaded them into Mattox's rocket launcher. Then, clutching the body of her oldest friend, she dove down.
> 
> As they reached the enemy, the world exploded to black.

**Solstice Greaves (Resplendent)**

> Stand your ground until you're the last one standing.
> 
> Daimos-22 whipped his free arm as he called to the crowds of Humans, pleading with them to hurry. The compound must have been their home for years—that was his guess based on the armfuls of possessions passing him. But it was flooding now. Sinking.
> 
> The tunnel—the only one that hadn't flooded, made of cracked, rotten wood and brittle metal—was barely big enough to stand in, but it would get them to the surface. ""Come on!"" the Titan called as they streamed past him.
> 
> Children and old folks crying. ""I know,"" he said, straining not to shout. ""But we have to move.""
> 
> A woman dropped her enormous suitcase, and he kicked it aside. She looked back at the bag, and then she was gone in the crowd.
> 
> The whole structure groaned. Daimos looked up, scanning up and down the tunnel. It didn't sound right at all.
> 
> The section of roof above him split open, and the whole tunnel buckled. He could hear the tension grinding in his arms as he pressed on the roof. Hold.
> 
> He kept calling out, and they kept running past.
> 
> He held and held. And when he let go, he knew he was the last one left.

**Solstice Mark (Resplendent)**

> Birds fly in formation so they do not lose their way.
> 
> ""Anokai Tai, checking in.""
> 
> The Titan listened for a response as he throttled the Wayfarer Z over the rubble of a collapsed building and onto what had once been a busy road. He watched for activity. Nothing yet.
> 
> ""Tai, we see you,"" the voice on the radio came back. ""About twelve klicks to the rendezvous point.""
> 
> The Titan accelerated, staying low. He was picking up a pair of Guardians—two more just like him who had been passing information to an offworld ship when their vehicle was destroyed. Just a few weeks ago, he would have scoffed at putting three people on a Sparrow. Now pickups like this were almost normal.
> 
> A large Legion ship—he didn't know what kind—lay strewn across his path. He pulled back on the stick to rise over the wreck, but something within the Sparrow sputtered.
> 
> A second later, that something caught fire.
> 
> No no—
> 
> The Sparrow slammed down onto the cratered road. Plasma bolts flew past Tai. Ambush.
> 
> Tai leapt off the Wayfarer Z and ducked behind it, firing as a platoon of Red Legion emerged from the wreck. He managed to get two before the Sparrow exploded.

#Hunter Rare Set

**Solstice Mask (Rekindled)**

> Hide your true face from the sun, lest you get burned.
> 
> ""Now is not the time, Cayde."" Sword strike. Forty-one Cabal down.
> 
> ""On the contrary, my horned friend."" Throwing knife. Thirty-six. ""These red lesions are burning down our house. The stakes have never been higher!"" Hand cannon. Thirty-seven. ""Let's say… two thousand Glimmer a head.""
> 
> ""Ikora said 'Red Legion,' you fool. And no."" Sword strike. Forty-two and forty-three.
> 
> ""Five thousand.""
> 
> ""I will not wager against you when our home—""
> 
> Severed.
> 
> ""Wh— What is this? Cayde, what have you done to me? Another trick to win a bet we haven't made?""
> 
> ""Ugh.""
> 
> ""Cayde!""
> 
> ""No, you big ox! I can't… ugh. Can't you see that it got me too? Look out!"" Sidearm. Thirty-eight.
> 
> ""The Light is beyond my reach. My Ghost is empty."" Sword strike. Forty-four. ""This means…""
> 
> ""They need us. We should split up."" Throwing knife. Thirty-nine. ""I'll sweep the streets, you take the—""
> 
> ""Ten thousand."" Sword strike. Forty-five. ""THESE are the highest stakes."" Sword strike. Forty-six. ""You want a bet, Hunter? Let's bet. The only prize is our lives. For all time.”
> 
> Hand cannon. Firefly! Forty, forty-one, forty-two. ""You're on.""

**Solstice Grasps (Rekindled)**

> Hold too tight and it could all slip away.
> 
> ""How many was that? I sorta stopped counting a while ago.""
> 
> Cayde's whisper is loud enough to be heard by any Red Legion nearby, but he'd solved that problem with three flashes of his knife in the last two minutes. His Ghost doesn't respond.
> 
> ""Never mind, never mind. You know, this would go a lot faster if I could draw 'em out somehow. Use something for bait. Something small.""
> 
> His Ghost still doesn't respond.
> 
> ""Not like you. Something without a big glowy eye. Wait, shh-shh-shh…""
> 
> He ducks into the shadows. Two Legionaries flanking a Goliath tank waddle past his hiding spot. No need to be a hero, he thinks. At least, not a dead one. Not yet.
> 
> ""Three more blocks and we're in business. You sure you can still access the terminals?""
> 
> No response.
> 
> ""You're right, I shouldn't doubt you. Just because we haven't touched the Light in nine hours doesn't mean that you can't still, you know, do your thing with the beam. But you're my last hope, little buddy. Zavala's gonna take years to build up his big space fleet. Ikora's gonna sit and stare at a Traveler-shaped hole in the ground for just as long. It's up to us now. You with me?""
> 
> A loud whisper: ""Always.""

**Solstice Vest (Rekindled)**

> Memories of lost loves burn in your heart.
> 
> ""Vanguard emergency override, auth chartreuse seven seven dash six.""
> 
> [Good morning, Hunter Vanguard. Automated voice help system engaged. How can I help you today?]
> 
> ""I need to take down a giant space rhino before he sees me.""
> 
> [I assume you're referring to a Cabal enemy. Can you provide me with any more information?]
> 
> ""He looks like a fifteen-foot-tall spiky cloud with wings and a cape.""
> 
> [That doesn't align with reference images I have on file. Is he wearing some kind of special armor?]
> 
> ""Either that or he's got a real weird body. We're talking weirder than usual.""
> 
> [How can I help you today?]
> 
> ""Sorry. Sorry. So we need to kill this Ghaul guy. I need ideas. How did that one fireteam take down Crota again?""
> 
> [They infiltrated the Ascendant Realm and confronted him at his Oversoul throne.]
> 
> ""OK, that's probably not gonna work here. What about Skolas?""
> 
> [Please specify: when he met his execution in the Prison of Elders—]
> 
> ""Nope.""
> 
> [—or when he brought his House of Wolves across time through Vex time gates—]
> 
> ""Now we're talking! Vex stuff. Teleporting. How do I do that?""

**Solstice Strides (Rekindled)**
> Jump not from the pan into the flames.
> 
> ""So your name is 'Failsafe'?""
> 
> ""Yes! And your name is the Cayde unit!"" (""You're an Exo. Human brain in a robot body. Weird mouth lights."")
> 
> ""Wait, who was that?""
> 
> ""Who was who? I am me!""
> 
> ""It doesn't matter. You don't know what'll happen if I do this. You're an AI, just like one back home that told me about this place.""
> 
> ""That is incorrect!"" (""I'm about a thousand times smarter."")
> 
> ""If you're so smart, how come you crashed your big ship into a horse moon?""
> 
> ""That is very rude!""
> 
> ""Look, we don't have a lot of time. I'm just gonna wire up this Vex teleporter to my triple jump circuits. What's the worst that could happen?""
> 
> ""Based on my cycles analyzing Vex portal technology, one of the many alarming yet likely outcomes is that your body and consciousness are separated into two distinct antimatter dimensions!""
> 
> ""Ah, you're making that up. Here goes.""
> 
> ""Please wait a moment, Cayde unit! I have not encountered anyone else on 7066 Nessus since the crash of the Exodus Black."" (""I'm not good at being lonely."") ""If you are absorbed into a quasi-space pseudorealm—""
> 
> ""Sorry, Failsafe, gotta be brave here.""
> 
> Dzzt.

**Solstice Cloak (Rekindled)**
> Mistakes can burn, even in the dead of night.
>

> Knowledge is power. Seize it all.
> 
> Dax Etono moved through the darkness of the Red Legion storehouse as quietly as he could until he reached the control panels at the far end. He looked around, hoping the towers of equipment and storage containers would keep him hidden.
> 
> Lit the panel up.
> 
> This panel would generally be used by its owners just for inventory on this one unit. After the Cabal had seized the buildings here, however, the Guardians realized the Legion had unlocked the network to such a degree that if you could access any panel, you could get in almost anywhere in their systems. Dax pulled the buckle from his belt—a mag-hack. He let it click against the panel, and it started to copy over information. Tons of it.
> 
> The lights came on. Dax cursed, turning around. Footsteps echoed from both entrances. No enemies were visible yet. He drew his weapon and retrieved the mag-hack. Flicked a switch on its smooth metal side. At least he'd get the Vanguard some of the data.
> 
> Three Cabal rounded the corner, firing. Dax took aim to defend himself as information began blazing across the galaxy.

> Do more than survive. Change your reality.

> ""You can make anything sound like no big deal if you say it the right way.""
> 
> Gemma Nixx knew that from very early on, and yet it still never ceased to bother her. You could say, ""The Red Legion is wiping out innocent people all around the City,"" all matter-of-fact. But now, as she led maimed and hollow-eyed stragglers through ridges of junk and cratered earth, those words swelled and distorted until they were her entire reality.
> 
> You could say, ""You've lost your regenerative ability, but you're still able to fight."" But saying it didn't get her new feelings across. The pressure of the rebar she grabbed to steady herself was not pain; yet, like every sensation now, it stung in her brain.
> 
> ""This way!"" Gemma located a hatch and held it open, watching as the survivors filed in.
> 
> Then she slammed it shut, and a few seconds later, the hidden transport the people had crawled into revved its engine and burst from a pile of debris. Gemma watched them go.
> 
> She waved and saw a puff of smoke in a burnt-out building a quarter mile away. Then she saw a hole in her hand. And then nothing.

> He was floating just about one meter off a comms satellite. I know, 'cause I was talking to him. Not in person—I was manning about 30 weather drones, so I had this array of camera views and readouts. I see him drifting there, drill in hand, by an open panel.
> 
> This was a Guardian, with a capital G. I mean, it makes me laugh now. I was thinking, I've seen that guy win ten in a row in the Crucible. Why is he fixing a satellite?
> 
> He told me, all casual, that the comms had been acting up, and he was saving the regular maintenance crew a trip into orbit in the middle of a storm. I even asked myself at the time, wow, do Guardians do that?
> 
> Anyway, I came to find out, the second the sensors beyond the Wall started going dark, he'd suspected sabotage. Came straight to investigate. He didn't want to freak me out.
> 
> He was one of the first that we lost during the invasion. The screen just filled with orange and white. Gone.

> Flames lick at your heels but you are too fast.
> 
> Do you know what it takes to keep moving when you're so afraid—SO afraid?
> 
> In the EDZ, we were starting to mount an organized defense. It was still Cabal territory. She and I drew the short straw to hit a rolling transport: a fat Cabal train on wheels coming out of a munitions depot and heading for the Farm.
> 
> So we're waiting behind a ridge and the carrier approaches. She blasts it with her Grenade Launcher. The shell slams into a tread on the carrier and it just… sticks. Doesn't blow up. I look at her. She's gritting her teeth.
> 
> While I'm still in shock, she leaps to her feet, hops on a Sparrow, and zips about a mile down the road. I watch through the binocs. She pulls out a sidearm and aims from behind a bunch of steel girders. Shoots at the shell in the transport tread. Takes another shot. Three. Five. It's unlike her to miss.
> 
> Then I see why: her whole body is shaking with fear.
> 
> Finally she detonates the shell. And I mean, I have never seen a blast like this. An orange dome that reaches almost all the way back to me. It melts the rubber on my goggles.
> 
> It was the right move. You don't come back from that, though.

**Solstice Cloak (Resplendent)**

> Let the fear in your bones drive you to resist.
> 
> Before they took the Traveler away, we thought we were tough. All of us. But man, without the Ghosts, we became real vulnerable for a while. At least I did. Ghaul absolutely had us pegged.
> 
> A bunch of Fallen were trying to establish a base of operations near the old Nessus crash site after the boss left. When Trake and I arrived on Nessus to help organize resistance against the Red Legion, we engaged the Fallen—we couldn't let them build up their forces.
> 
> So the ground trembles when one of the Fallen transports blows up, and I lose my grip on my rifle—it slips right down the ridge we're taking cover behind. I've never felt so stupid, and I… I couldn't move.
> 
> Trake shakes me out of my stupor, and we scramble over the ridge to get my rifle. I slide down and grab it while he covers me. It feels like the world is frozen in place. I can still picture him shooting round after round as we head back to safety.
> 
> He's right on my heels, but… I'm sorry. No, he, uh, he was hit in the neck and, uh, that was it.
> 
> The fear—I can't describe it at all. But I remember it in my bones.

> This was the eleventh Fallen she'd taken down since she'd been within sight of the Shard, and the last one standing between her and recovering her power.
> 
> She turned to the Shard and took a step toward it. Another step, past two Dregs she'd taken from above an hour earlier. Another step, over a Wretch that had caught her off-guard right after. One more step as she stretched out her palm to touch the surface of the Shard, closed her eyes, and waited.
> 
> And waited.
> 
> Nothing.
> 
> Her eyes shot open, and she stared at the cast-off piece of the Traveler. Silent. Disbelieving. Furious. Pleading. Then... serene.

> The ground shook as three Red Legion Harvesters flew overhead. Not as wrong as them.
> 
> This place, this holy place, this place more sacred to Guardians than any other in the system... now a thoroughfare for Cabal to tread upon without reverence. To tunnel through without regard. To befoul without a thought. Ikora's anger had bubbled to the surface often since this war had begun, but seeing the Red Legion here had her as persistently furious as any time she could remember.
> 
> She checked her provisions and ammunition. The Vex were here as well, but she knew that as long as she stayed away from the machines, they would present no threat. She would deal with them later. For now, she set out for the Red Legion base she had flown past on her initial descent.

> Her shotgun was lost, lying broken outside the guard tower of a Red Legion base a few klicks east. She'd emptied it into an Incendior and then used it to bludgeon a Psion into the ground. But the ships didn't stop flying overhead. The patrols didn't become any less frequent. Nothing had changed.

> In the blink of an eye, life can turn from sweet to bitter.

> From the cockpit of her jumpship, Kanmu mouthed words in almost perfect sync with the voices behind her. She'd spent most of this assignment ferrying Cryptarchs from planet to planet, and these scholars always had the same conversations over and over again.
> 
> She pantomimed a deep belly laugh right on cue.
> 
> Something was wrong this time, though. That laugh didn't sound right. Looking behind her, she realized one of the Cryptarchs was choking—probably on one of those hard candies they always seemed to have. She freed herself from the cockpit and hurried back to them, finding the afflicted scholar doubled over and gasping.
> 
> She positioned herself behind him, and time slowed. As her arms wrapped around the form in front of her, she made a fist with one hand and grasped it with the other, trying to pull up into the abdomen.

He leaned harder into Aiza-3, who nearly buckled at the unexpected weight shift. She steadied herself quickly, and they carried on.
> 
> ""Do you need help up there?"" From behind them, Ivola's footfalls were uneven, owing to the hole in his right thigh. Ziv wasn't sure he could help if he wanted to. Aiza must have felt the same way.

> From there in the dirt, he shouldered his rifle and started shooting.

**Solstice Robes (Resplendent)**
> The right perspective can give you the perfect advantage.

> Nethe Pav breathed, tried to find time within time. She was cut off from her exit, the path in front of her blocked by rubble from her own blast. She had taken out three Cabal—they'd fired on her nonstop for what felt like hours but was surely minutes—and now there was one left, wounded, still behind her. She figured she could just leave it.
> 
> She was wrong. From behind her came sounds of the lumbering beast. Turning, she fired.
> 
> Nothing. Her weapon was dead or jammed or—it didn't matter. She threw it down and crouched behind a pillar with her blade as the Cabal fired. Once. Twice. Click.
> 
> The clatter of its rifle hitting the ground. Nethe peered around the pillar in time to see it advancing with its own blade drawn.

> 
> The story took his mind off his aching legs. His ship had blown up miles outside the City, but he finally saw the Tower coming into view. He was deep into a daydream about napping when he heard a crash up ahead.
> 
> Serrano picked up speed as he approached a curve in the road, and when he rounded it, he saw the dust cloud first. As it cleared, he saw the overturned Sparrow and, worse, the Guardian underneath it. His heart sank as he ran toward them, but as he got closer, he could tell it was too late. He touched the Guardian's shoulders, bowing his head for a moment.
> 
> His gaze turned to the Sparrow. A guilty pang made him hesitate, but this Guardian didn't need it anymore. He righted it and climbed on.
> 
> Flying fast around a curve, Serrano spotted a troop of Cabal firing and closing in on an encampment. The cowering civilians managed to get a couple good shots against the invaders as he watched, but they wouldn't get enough before the Cabal surrounded them.
> 
> Then he saw the Incendior among the beasts. That was the answer.

Some Guardian—who had allegedly gotten their Light back—was trying to make it through this place to find whatever it housed. She was just here to help clear it out, along with several other Guardians who weren't so blessed.

2018-04-02 17:39:26,"Immanuel Kant on Enlightenment Immanuel Kant

""An Answer to the Question: What is Enlightenment?""  

(Was ist Äufklarung?)

(30 September, 1784)

Enlightenment is man's release from his self-incurred immaturity. Immaturity is man's inability to make use of his understanding without direction from another. This immaturity is self-imposed when its cause lies not in lack of reason but in lack of resolution and courage to use it without direction from another. Sapere aude! ""Have courage to use your own reason!"" -- that is the motto of enlightenment.

Laziness and cowardice are the reasons why so great a portion of mankind, after nature has long since discharged them from external direction (naturaliter maiorennes [those who come of age by virtue of nature]), nevertheless remains under lifelong tutelage, and why it is so easy for others to set themselves up as their guardians. It is so easy not to be of age. If I have a book that understands for me, a pastor who has a conscience for me, a physician who decides my diet, and so forth, I need not trouble myself. I need not think, if I can only pay -- others will easily undertake the irksome work for me. That the step to competence is held to be very dangerous by the far greater portion of mankind (and by the entire fair sex) -- quite apart from its being arduous is seen to by those guardians who have so kindly assumed superintendence over them. After the guardians have first made their domestic cattle dumb and have made sure that these placid creatures will not dare take a single step without the harness of the cart to which they are tethered, the guardians then show them the danger which threatens if they try to go alone. Actually, however, this danger is not so great, for by falling a few times they would finally learn to walk alone. But an example of this failure makes them timid and ordinarily frightens them away from all further trials.

Thus it is very difficult for any single individual to work himself out of the life under tutelage which has become almost his nature. He has come to be fond of his state, and he is for the present really incapable of making use of his reason, for no one has ever let him try it out. Statutes and formulas, those mechanical tools of the rational employment or rather misemployment of his natural gifts, are the fetters of an everlasting tutelage. Whoever throws them off makes only an uncertain leap over the narrowest ditch because he is not accustomed to that kind of free motion. Therefore, there are few who have succeeded by their own exercise of mind both in freeing themselves from incompetence and in achieving a steady pace.

But that the public should enlighten itself is more likely; indeed, if only freedom is granted, enlightenment is almost sure to follow. For there will always be some independent thinkers, even among the established guardians of the great masses, who, after throwing off the yoke of tutelage from their own shoulders, will disseminate the spirit of the rational appreciation of both their own worth and every man's vocation for thinking for himself. But be it noted that the public, which has first been brought under this yoke by their guardians, forces the guardians themselves to remain bound when it is incited to do so by some of the guardians who are themselves capable of some enlightenment -- so harmful is it to implant prejudices, for they later take vengeance on their cultivators or on their descendants. Thus the public can only slowly attain enlightenment. Perhaps a fall of personal despotism or of avaricious or tyrannical oppression may be accomplished by revolution, but never a true reform in ways of thinking. Farther, new prejudices will serve as well as old ones to harness the great unthinking masses.

Nothing is required for this enlightenment, however, except freedom, and indeed the most harmless among all the things to which this term can properly be applied. It is the freedom to make public use of one's reason at every point. But I hear on all sides, ""Do not argue!"" The Officer says: ""Do not argue but drill!"" The tax collector: ""Do not argue but pay!"" The cleric: ""Do not argue but believe!"" Only one prince in the world [Frederick II (the Great) of Prussia] says, ""Argue as much as you will, and about what you will, but obey!"" Everywhere there is restriction on freedom. Which restriction is an obstacle to enlightenment, and which is not an obstacle but a promoter of it? I answer: The public use of one's reason must always be free, and it alone can bring about enlightenment among men. The private use of reason, on the other hand, may often be very narrowly restricted without particularly hindering the progress of enlightenment. By the public use of one's reason I understand the use which a person makes of it as a scholar before the reading public. Private use I call that which one may make of it in a particular civil post or office which is entrusted to him. Many affairs which are conducted in the interest of the community require a certain mechanism through which some members of the community must passively conduct themselves with an artificial unanimity, so that the government may direct them to public ends, or at least prevent them from destroying those ends. Here argument is certainly not allowed -- one must obey. But so far as a part of the mechanism regards himself at the same time as a member of the whole community or of a society of world citizens, and thus in the role of a scholar who addresses the public (in the proper sense of the word) through his writings, he certainly can argue without hurting the affairs for which he is in part responsible as a passive member. Thus it would be ruinous for an officer in service to debate about the suitability or utility of a command given to him by his superior; he must obey. But the right to make remarks on errors in the military service and to lay them before the public for judgment cannot equitably be refused him as a scholar. The citizen cannot refuse to pay the taxes imposed on him; indeed, an impudent complaint at those levied on him can be punished as a scandal (as it could occasion general refractoriness). But the same person nevertheless does not act contrary to his duty as a citizen, when, as a scholar, he publicly expresses his thoughts on the inappropriateness or even the injustices of these levies, Similarly a clergyman is obligated to make his sermon to his pupils in catechism and his congregation conform to the symbol of the church which he serves, for he has been accepted on this condition. But as a scholar he has complete freedom, even the calling, to communicate to the public all his carefully tested and well meaning thoughts on that which is erroneous in the symbol and to make suggestions for the better organization of the religious body and church. In doing this there is nothing that could be laid as a burden on his conscience. For what he teaches as a consequence of his office as a representative of the church, this he considers something about which he has not freedom to teach according to his own lights; it is something which he is appointed to propound at the dictation of and in the name of another. He will say, ""Our church teaches this or that; those are the proofs which it adduces."" He thus extracts all practical uses for his congregation from statutes to which he himself would not subscribe with full conviction but to the enunciation of which he can very well pledge himself because it is not impossible that truth lies hidden in them, and, in any case, there is at least nothing in them contradictory to inner religion. For if he believed he had found such in them, he could not conscientiously discharge the duties of his office; he would have to give it up. The use, therefore, which an appointed teacher makes of his reason before his congregation is merely private, because this congregation is only a domestic one (even if it be a large gathering); with respect to it, as a priest, he is not free, nor can he be free, because he carries out the orders of another. But as a scholar, whose writings speak to his public, the world, the clergyman in the public use of his reason enjoys an unlimited freedom to use his own reason to speak in his own person. That the guardian of the people (in spiritual things) should themselves be incompetent is an absurdity which amounts to the eternalization of absurdities.

But would not a society of clergymen, perhaps a church conference or a venerable presbytery (as they call themselves among the Dutch), be justified in obligating itself by oath to a certain unchangeable symbol in order to enjoy an unceasing guardianship over each of its numbers and thereby over the people as a whole, and even to make it eternal? I answer that this is altogether impossible. Such contract, made to shut off all further enlightenment from the human race, is absolutely null and void even if confirmed by the supreme power, by parliaments, and by the most ceremonious of peace treaties. An age cannot bind itself and ordain to put the succeeding one into such a condition that it cannot extend its (at best very occasional) knowledge, purify itself of errors, and progress in general enlightenment. That would be a crime against human nature, the proper destination of which lies precisely in this progress and the descendants would be fully justified in rejecting those decrees as having been made in an unwarranted and malicious manner. The touchstone of everything that can be concluded as a law for a people lies in the question whether the people could have imposed such a law on itself. Now such religious compact might be possible for a short and definitely limited time, as it were, in expectation of a better. One might let every citizen, and especially the clergyman, in the role of scholar, make his comments freely and publicly, i.e. through writing, on the erroneous aspects of the present institution. The newly introduced order might last until insight into the nature of these things had become so general and widely approved that through uniting their voices (even if not unanimously) they could bring a proposal to the throne to take those congregations under protection which had united into a changed religious organization according to their better ideas, without, however hindering others who wish to remain in the order. But to unite in a permanent religious institution which is not to be subject to doubt before the public even in the lifetime of one man, and thereby to make a period of time fruitless in the progress of mankind toward improvement, thus working to the disadvantage of posterity -- that is absolutely forbidden. For himself (and only for a short time) a man may postpone enlightenment in what he ought to know, but to renounce it for posterity is to injure and trample on the rights of mankind. And what a people may not decree for itself can even less be decreed for them by a monarch, for his lawgiving authority rests on his uniting the general public will in his own. If he only sees to it that all true or alleged improvement stands together with civil order, he can leave it to his subjects to do what they find necessary for their spiritual welfare. This is not his concern, though it is incumbent on him to prevent one of them from violently hindering another in determining and promoting this welfare to the best of his ability. To meddle in these matters lowers his own majesty, since by the writings in which his own subjects seek to present their views he may evaluate his own governance. He can do this when, with deepest understanding, he lays upon himself the reproach, Caesar non est supra grammaticos  [Ceasar is not above the grammarians]. Far more does he injure his own majesty when he degrades his supreme power by supporting the ecclesiastical despotism of some tyrants in his state over his other subjects.

If we are asked, ""Do we now live in an enlightened age?"" the answer is, ""No ,"" but we do live in an age of enlightenment. As things now stand, much is lacking which prevents men from being, or easily becoming, capable of correctly using their own reason in religious matters with assurance and free from outside direction. But on the other hand, we have clear indications that the field has now been opened wherein men may freely deal with these things and that the obstacles to general enlightenment or the release from self-imposed tutelage are gradually being reduced. In this respect, this is the age of enlightenment, or the century of Frederick [the Great].

A prince who does not find it unworthy of himself to say that he holds it to be his duty to prescribe nothing to men in religious matters but to give them complete freedom while renouncing the haughty name of tolerance, is himself enlightened and deserves to be esteemed by the grateful world and posterity as the first, at least from the side of government, who divested the human race of its tutelage and left each man free to make use of his reason in matters of conscience. Under him venerable ecclesiastics are allowed, in the role of scholar, and without infringing on their official duties, freely to submit for public testing their judgments and views which here and there diverge from the established symbol. And an even greater freedom is enjoyed by those who are restricted by no official duties. This spirit of freedom spreads beyond this land, even to those in which it must struggle with external obstacles erected by a government which misunderstands its own interest. For an example gives evidence to such a government that in freedom there is not the least cause for concern about public peace and the stability of the community. Men work themselves gradually out of barbarity if only intentional artifices are not made to hold them in it.

I have placed the main point of enlightenment -- the escape of men from their self-imposed immaturity -- chiefly in matters of religion because our rulers have no interest in playing guardian with respect to the arts and sciences and also because religious incompetence is not only the most harmful but also the most degrading of all. But the manner of thinking of the head of a state who favors religious enlightenment goes further, and he sees that there is no danger to his lawgiving in allowing his subjects to make public use of their reason and to publish their thoughts on a better formulation of his legislation and even their open-minded criticisms of the laws already made. Of this we have a shining example wherein no monarch is superior to him we honor.

But only one who is himself enlightened, is not afraid of shadows, and has a numerous and well-disciplined army to assure public peace, can say: ""Argue as much as you will, and about what you will, only obey!"" A republic could not dare say such a thing. Here is shown a strange and unexpected trend in human affairs in which almost everything, looked at in the large, is paradoxical. A greater degree of civil freedom appears advantageous to the freedom of mind of the people, and yet it places inescapable limitations upon it. A lower degree of civil freedom, on the contrary, provides the mind with room for each man to extend himself to his full capacity. As nature has uncovered from under this hard shell the seed for which she most tenderly cares -- the propensity and vocation to free thinking -- this gradually works back upon the character of the people, who thereby gradually become capable of acting freely; finally, it affects the principles of government, which finds it to its advantage to treat men, who are now more than machines, in accordance with their dignity.",DevilsBiographer,Reddit,Positive,0.12937229437229436
